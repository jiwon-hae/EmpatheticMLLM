29,6,"Oh, right, I forgot."
29,7,"I'm sorry, I got carried away."
29,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
29,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."

29,11,That sounds really painful to imagine.
29,12,That sounds like a really tough outcome to imagine.

38,2,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
38,3,I'm so hurt right now.
38,4,"I'm so sorry, that wasn't right of me."

39,7,"It’s not nice, is it?"
39,8,"Okay, ask away."
39,9,"Are you feeling stuck, too?"
39,10,That's a really good question.
39,11,"It's hard to see past the surface sometimes, isn't it?"
39,12,"It's more than just that, isn't it?"
39,13,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your character's motivation.
39,14,I'm listening.
39,15,It's frustrating when you feel like there's a missing piece.
39,16,"Ouch, that stings."
39,17,"Okay, well, maybe you feel that way."
39,18,That must be frustrating.
40,0,"It's okay, take your time."

40,6,That sounds like fun!

40,9,"I know, I hate when that happens."
40,10,"Oh, wow."
40,11,"Oh, no, not again!"
40,12,Sounds like you’re really excited!

45,1,I feel bad that I hurt your feelings.
45,2,I just feel so embarrassed about it.

46,14,"Oh, wow."
47,0,"Oh no, that's a real problem, isn't it?"
47,1,I'm sure it will be.
47,2,I can see you're feeling confident.
47,3,"I'm just saying, we should have been prepared."
47,4,I can understand wanting to show that side of yourself.
47,5,"Oh, I see, you're feeling the pressure too."
47,6,I can see why you'd be hopeful.
47,7,I see what you're doing.
47,8,I'm so nervous about this.
47,9,"Okay, I get it, you're really excited."
47,11,"I just want you to be happy, you know?"
47,12,You seem really excited.
47,13,"It's all right, I understand."
47,14,I can't believe you would even ask.
47,15,"I know, it's intoxicating, isn't it?"
47,16,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
47,17,We really are.
48,0,Bye.
49,0,I'm sorry to hear that.
49,1,That sounds frustrating.
49,2,"Oh yeah, I can imagine that must have been awkward."
49,3,I guess I'll try to keep my head down then.
49,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and unsure of what to do.
49,5,"I'm here for you, whatever you decide."
49,6,It sounds like you're really torn.
49,7,"That's a tough question, isn't it?"
49,8,"It's a tough choice, isn't it?"
49,9,I'm just saying...
49,10,"It sounds like you're really struggling with this, Ross."
49,11,"It went well, but a little bit complicated."
49,12,"Oh, Ross, I'm so sorry."
49,13,I know that must have been difficult.
49,14,"Oh, wow, that's great!"
49,15,"I'm so happy for you, Ross!"
49,16,"Dana, of course!"
49,17,"Oh, wow, that's... unexpected."
49,18,Wasn’t she what?
49,19,"Right, right, of course."
49,20,"I know, I know, I’m just excited for you, man."
49,21,"Yeah, whatever."
50,0,"Morning! I'm doing well, just working on some projects."
50,1,"Whoa, easy there."
50,2,"I'm sorry, I just don't want him to be bothered."
50,3,What's up?
50,4,I'm just... feeling a bit off today.
50,5,That must be really stressful to hear.
50,6,That sounds incredibly stressful and frightening.
50,7,I know this must feel incredibly unsettling.
50,8,I can't believe they'd do this to you.
50,9,I know how much you care.
50,10,It’s just... I'm really scared.
50,11,"Hey, I get it."
50,12,"I'm just really scared, you know?"
50,13,"Hey, hey, I get it."
50,14,I know how much this hurts.
50,15,I can see you're really upset.
50,16,"I'm not doing so well, actually."
51,0,Hey.
51,1,I understand.
51,2,I appreciate you saying that.
51,3,I'm really sorry you feel that way.
51,4,"I just feel really hurt, you know?"
51,5,I guess I still have some things to learn.
51,6,"I'm sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
51,7,I know you've been really busy.
51,8,"I know, it's been a lot."
51,9,"I just want to feel like a priority, that's all."
51,10,I'm just trying to do what's best for us.
52,0,"It's hard, isn't it?"
52,1,I'm all ears.
52,2,I'm really nervous to say it.
52,3,"Oh, that must be frustrating."
52,4,I guess so.
52,5,That sounds really difficult.
52,6,"Oh, wow, you must really want to tell me!"
52,7,"Oh, it must be so hard to keep a secret like that."
52,8,No.
52,9,"Oh, you must be bursting to say something."
52,10,"You really want to know, huh?"
52,11,"Alright, alright, I'll bite, what's up?"
53,0,Hi there!
53,1,Hi there!
53,2,"Oh, no?"
53,3,I understand; it can be frustrating.
53,4,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
53,5,I'm feeling really down.
53,6,It was great seeing you too.
53,7,"No, I didn't."
53,8,That must have taken a lot of courage to say.
54,0,I appreciate you saying that.
54,1,I'm just worried about her.
54,2,It sounds like you're really frustrated and struggling with this.
54,3,"I know, honey, and I'm here for you."
54,4,"I understand, it's a lot to handle."
54,5,"I know, it's a lot to handle."
54,6,I can see how that would be terrifying.
54,7,"I know this is really hard, and I wish I could."
54,8,"I know, it's terrifying when it's someone you love."
54,9,I know how much that means.
54,10,"I know, and I appreciate that."
54,11,You’re not?
54,12,I’m just so glad you’re here.
54,13,I’m just so glad you’re not scared of me.
54,14,I can't stand the thought of that either.
54,15,"I know, and I want to be there for you."
54,16,"Yes, he is."
54,17,"Oh, thank God."
54,18,"It’s okay, I’m already feeling it, too."
54,19,I’m so excited to be an uncle.
54,20,I can't wait to be a mom.
54,21,I'm so glad.
54,22,I'm really glad you're here for me.
54,23,I just want to be a good brother.
55,0,"Me too, I'm so glad we did this."
55,1,"Me too, it was such a fun evening."
55,2,"Oh, that's too bad, but I understand."
55,3,"Yeah, it's a bit awkward, I know."
55,4,"Hi Krista, it's so nice to meet you!"
55,5,"Hi Rachel, it's so nice to meet you!"
55,6,"It's okay, you look great."
55,7,"Hey, be nice!"
55,8,I'm just teasing you!
55,9,"I'm just kidding, I had a great time too."
55,10,I'm just messing with you!
55,11,"Okay, okay, I get it!"
55,12,I am!
55,13,"Okay, okay, you win!"
55,14,I'm just teasing!
55,15,You're gonna try?
55,16,I'll get you for that!
56,0,"Wow, you must be starstruck!"
56,1,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it was you."
56,2,I can only imagine how surreal that must feel.
56,3,"Oh honey, that sounds absolutely awful."
56,4,"It's so frustrating to be stuck like this, isn't it?"
56,5,"That sounds really stressful, being stuck there with a stranger."
56,6,"This is so frustrating, I'm sorry you're stuck."
57,1,"No, I'm not."
57,2,"Okay, I understand."
57,3,"Okay, I understand."
58,0,It sounds like you have a pretty strong image of what that might be like.
58,1,"Wow, that sounds incredibly tedious."
58,2,"It can be really rewarding, helping someone find exactly what they want."
58,3,What's wrong?
58,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds really disappointing."
58,5,"I'm sorry, it's gone."
58,6,That sounds exhausting.
58,7,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
58,8,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you."
58,9,"Oh no, you're serious?"
59,0,That's wonderful to hear!
59,1,Thanks!
59,2,Sounds like a plan!
59,3,Sounds like you're feeling good about this.
59,4,I'm so glad to hear that!
59,5,You seem really proud of yourself.
59,6,You seem really proud of everyone.
59,7,I'm so proud of you.
59,8,I love you too!
59,9,I love you too!
61,0,That must be frustrating.
61,1,I feel so silly right now.
61,2,I can see you're really upset.
61,3,I feel like you're really upset right now.
61,4,I can see you're feeling a bit vulnerable right now.
61,5,You seem really upset.
61,6,"It sounds like you really wanted one, too."
61,7,"I know, it really hurts."
61,8,I understand.
62,0,Hey! What's up?
62,1,"Not so good, Bob."
62,2,"Oh, come on, don't be like that."
62,3,Sounds like you really miss him.
62,5,What's up?
62,6,"Yeah, we do."
62,7,That's still something!
62,8,"I'm not sure, what's making you ask?"
62,9,That must be disappointing to think about.
62,10,I can see that would make you feel conflicted.
62,11,I can see why you'd be hesitant.
63,0,"Oh, that's so exciting!"
63,1,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry you feel that way."
63,2,"Wow, that's amazing!"
63,3,"I know, right?"
63,4,"Wow, that's…incredible."
63,5,"Oh, wow, I can see how frustrating that would be."
63,6,"So, you're feeling a bit competitive about this?"
63,7,I understand; you want your wedding to feel unique.
64,0,That sounds incredibly hurtful and disrespectful.
64,1,I can see why that would be upsetting.
64,2,It sounds like that thought really bothers you.
64,3,"It's just a really uncomfortable thought, isn't it?"
64,4,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
64,5,That's a really sweet thought.
64,6,"I know, but…"
64,7,That actually sounds pretty cool!
64,8,"Oh, wow, you're actually excited!"
64,9,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're really disappointed."
64,10,"I get it, it's a big decision!"
64,11,"I know, it's frustrating when you have an idea and it gets dismissed."
64,12,"Oh, honey."
65,0,That's... really kind of you to say.
65,1,"Yes, really."
65,2,That's... incredible to hear.
65,3,It's nice to feel appreciated.
66,1,It's okay to feel lost when something good doesn't feel that way.
66,2,"Oh, that sounds incredibly stressful."
66,3,"I know, it sounds silly, but it felt like the end of the world."
66,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
66,5,"I know, it's just one thing after another, isn't it?"
66,6,It sounds like you're feeling really stressed about this.
66,7,I just feel like a prisoner of my own things sometimes.
66,8,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize it was so hard."
66,9,"I know, it's hard when things feel like they're falling apart."
66,10,I just don’t know what to say.
66,11,"Oh, sweetheart."
66,12,"I am, I am."
67,0,I can see why you'd be shocked.
67,1,I can't believe this is happening.
67,2,You're very welcome.
67,3,I'm so happy to hear that.
67,5,I'm happy to hear that.
67,6,I can't imagine how scary that must have been.
67,7,I'm so relieved I could do something.
67,8,I'm so happy I could help!
67,9,I'm just happy to be there for you.
67,10,That's a great idea!
67,11,"I just want you to know, I'm really touched."
67,12,"I know you’re going to tell her, Ross."
67,13,I promise.
67,14,"Oh, no!"
67,15,That sounds awful.
68,0,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
68,1,"You're welcome, I'm sure you'll do great."
68,2,I understand you're feeling nervous.
68,3,"Yes, you."
69,0,I'm so glad you think so.
69,1,"Sure, that sounds lovely."
69,2,"Okay, sounds good."
69,3,"Yeah, it's been a long day."
69,4,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
69,5,I'm sure it was.
69,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make it worse."
70,0,I'm glad you think so.
70,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound so dismissive."
70,2,"Oh, wow."
70,3,"Oh, I can see how that might be disappointing."
70,4,Oh.
70,5,I can see you're really attached to that canoe.
70,6,"You really don't want the canoe, do you?"
70,7,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
70,8,I can see you're really proud of it.
71,0,Hey.
71,1,I'm just feeling really lost right now.
72,0,"Oh wow, that's a lot to take in right now."
72,1,"Yes, one."
72,2,"I understand, you're trying to get something that isn't quite real."
72,3,I know this must be confusing.
72,4,That sounds like a really tough situation.
72,5,"I am, yes."
72,6,I see.
72,7,"I understand, it must be difficult."
73,0,"I understand, it's hard to set boundaries."
73,1,I understand this is frustrating.
73,2,It sounds like you're really trying to lighten the mood.
73,3,"Hey, what's wrong?"
73,4,"I'm feeling a little lost, too."
73,5,She's really struggling.
73,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was a touchy subject."
73,7,I don't know.
73,8,"Oh, that must have been disappointing."
73,9,Have a good time.
73,10,"Oh, right, sorry, I didn't mean to be so dismissive."
73,11,You don't sound like you're in a very good mood.
74,0,"Okay, I can do that."
74,1,It sounds like you're worried about hurting Jason's feelings.
74,2,It's tough when you know someone's feelings might get hurt.
74,3,It sounds like you're feeling conflicted.
74,4,I know it's tough to feel like you're choosing between people's feelings.
74,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way."
74,6,You're really standing up for Jason.
75,0,Hi there.
76,0,"Yeah, it sounds like it's pretty widespread."
76,1,"Oh, that must feel validating."
76,2,It sounds like something unpleasant happened.
76,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit resigned about it all.
76,4,It sounds like you're feeling pretty conflicted about it.
76,5,It sounds like you really enjoyed yourself.
76,6,"Yeah, it really was."
76,7,I do.
77,0,"Not yet, but I'm sure we'll find the perfect one."
77,1,I understand how frustrating that can be.
77,2,"That’s a sweet name, I like it."
77,3,That sounds like a lovely name.
77,4,"Hello, little one."
78,0,I feel trapped.
78,1,"Oh, you're feeling trapped?"
78,2,I know it's scary.
78,3,He's trying to protect you.
78,4,"I know, it’s scary!"
78,5,I can't believe he's doing that!
79,0,"Okay, if you're sure."
79,1,"I know, it's frustrating when that happens."
79,2,"I know, I just hate to mess things up."
79,3,"Yeah, really."
79,4,"Oh, you're trying to make me feel better."
79,5,"It's a lot to adjust to, isn't it?"
79,6,"It's a lot to adjust to, isn't it?"
79,7,I understand.
80,0,"Wow, that must be tough to think about."
80,1,"Of course, Joey, anytime."
80,2,"He is pretty dreamy, isn't he?"
80,3,Hot!
80,4,It must be exciting to see him in person.
80,5,"Oh, honey, you poor thing!"
81,0,"I promise, your secret is safe with me."
81,1,About... everything.
81,2,"Oh wow, that's so sweet of him."
81,3,"I know, it's so sweet of him!"
81,4,I will!
81,5,About the party!
81,6,I'm so happy for you!
81,7,You're really good at this!
81,8,"I'm so sorry, I really messed up."
81,9,I'm so sorry; that really stinks.
81,10,"Wow, you must be so excited!"
81,11,"I'm so sorry, honey."
81,12,"It just feels like that sometimes, I know."
81,13,I'm so sorry you feel left out.
81,14,That's a really rotten feeling.
81,15,It really does feel like you're always on the outside.
81,16,"It's just frustrating when you feel left out, isn't it?"
82,0,"I know, it's frustrating when you're left hanging like that."
82,1,"Oh, honey."
82,2,"I know, and I'm sorry, it's just... complicated."
82,3,That must be really tough.
82,4,I know this is really difficult.
82,5,"That sounds really painful, Chandler."
82,6,"I know it's complicated, but he's still your dad."
82,7,It sounds like you have a lot of complicated feelings about him.
82,9,"You’re really not looking forward to this, are you?"
82,10,"You know, I get it, it's complicated."
82,11,I can see why you'd want to do that.
83,0,I'm here.
83,1,"I'm doing alright, just a little lost, I guess."
83,2,"I'm just here, feeling a bit lost."
83,3,I'm not sure I would.
84,0,I understand how scary that must feel.
84,1,"Oh, that must feel so frustrating!"
84,2,"Oh, honey, that's a lot to take in right now."
84,3,I can't believe this is happening.
84,4,"Oh, honey, I know this is a lot."
84,5,"Oh, honey."
84,6,"You're really hurting right now, aren't you?"
85,0,That sounds frustrating.
85,1,"It's alright, things happen."
85,2,"Oh, it's a really interesting story."
85,3,"Oh, did I?"
85,4,It sounds like you're a little frustrated that you can't remember!
86,0,"Sure, here you go."
86,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
86,2,It's just been a really rough day.
86,3,"Oh, I get it, that must have been a little awkward."
86,4,"Oh, so you're feeling a bit confused now?"
86,5,"It's okay, we all make mistakes."
86,6,I guess I misjudged you.
86,7,It sounds like you've been looking for a way to relax.
86,8,It's a relief to find someone who understands.
86,9,"It's okay, I get it."
86,10,I can't believe I almost got you!
87,0,"No, I'm not."
87,1,You seem a little down.
87,2,A little.
87,3,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
87,4,That sounds like a lot of work.
87,5,Hi.
87,6,"Not great, honestly."
87,7,That's great to hear!
87,8,"Oh, wow."
87,9,That's good to hear.
88,0,I'm glad we could find some common ground.
88,1,"Thank you, I needed to hear that."
88,2,What's on your mind?
88,3,I understand.
89,0,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
89,1,"I know, that really adds to the misery."
89,2,"Hey, I can only imagine how exhausted you must be."
89,4,"Thanks, I’m trying."
89,5,"You seem frustrated, Rach."
89,6,"I mean, I'm not handling it well at all."
89,7,I hear you; it sounds like you're feeling pretty helpless right now.
89,8,It sounds like you're feeling a bit dismissed right now.
89,9,"Oh, honey, that must be really hard to hear."
89,10,"I'm so sorry, that must feel really frustrating."
89,11,That must feel incredibly frustrating.
89,12,"It's hard to watch, isn't it?"
89,15,It sounds like you're really feeling conflicted about this.
89,16,I can't believe you're so sure of that.
90,0,I can see you're really upset.
91,0,I understand why you're frustrated right now.
92,0,I hear you; it really does.
92,1,I'm really sorry you're feeling that way.
93,0,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
93,1,I understand it's a tough situation.
93,2,I'm not sure that's enough.
93,3,"Wow, that's a serious commitment."
93,4,"I'm glad you're proud of your hole, Joe."
93,5,"I know, it's devastating."
93,6,"Oh, man, that really sucks."
93,7,I think I stubbed my toe...
94,0,I'm listening.
94,1,I'm sorry if my words caused you pain.
94,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
94,3,I don't think I like the sound of that.
94,4,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
94,5,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
94,6,"I am so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you like this."
94,7,I don't want to lose you either.
94,8,I’d be honored.
94,9,I don't think I'm ready for that.
94,10,I really hope I can.
94,11,I'm so glad to hear that.
94,12,I can arrange that.
94,13,I’m so sorry.
94,14,Anything you want.
94,15,"Okay, I'm listening."
95,0,"Oh wow, that sounds exciting!"
95,1,I am so excited for us!
95,2,"Oh, wow!"
95,3,I can see how that might be disappointing.
95,4,I am so excited for us!
95,5,"Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
95,6,"I'm so sorry, I can see this is hard for you."
95,7,"Oh, honey."
95,8,"I know, I know."
95,9,"I know, it's just... a lot to process."
95,10,"I'm just not ready, okay?"
95,11,I just don't think I'm ready.
95,12,I just don't know if I'm ready for this.
95,13,"Yeah, it kind of is."
95,14,I can't believe you're doing this to me!
95,15,"...dessert, I know."
95,16,"I know, it's tough."
95,17,"You're really struggling with this, aren't you?"
96,0,"Hi Monica, what's on your mind?"
96,1,I'm feeling really anxious right now.
96,2,What's wrong?
96,3,"Alright, I'll wait."
96,4,You're welcome.
97,0,I'm ready.
97,1,"Alright, I got you."
97,2,I got it!
97,3,"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
98,1,I can understand your skepticism.
99,0,Hey there! How are you doing?
99,1,How are you doing?
99,2,"Me too, I think it would have complicated things."
99,3,It would have been such a mess.
99,4,"Oh, wow, that would have been terrible."
99,5,I would have been so sad.
99,6,"Oh honey, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
99,7,"Oh, wow."
99,8,I'm so sorry you're hurting.
99,9,"Oh, that's a bummer."
99,10,I feel your frustration.
99,11,"Oh, wow, that’s a relief."
99,12,"Yes, it is me."
99,13,"Oh no, is everything okay?"
99,14,Is everything alright?
99,15,I’m so ready!
99,16,I'm so excited!
99,17,I'm so glad!
99,18,I understand.
100,0,"Oh, that must feel like such a relief."
100,1,It's okay to feel a little self-conscious about it.
100,2,"Oh, wow, that must be such a relief."
100,3,I don't think I could do that.
100,4,"I'm just a little nervous, that's all."
100,5,I'm feeling a little self-conscious now.
100,6,"Oh, no, what is it then?"
100,7,"No, that's not what I expected."
101,0,"Oh, that sounds really frustrating."
101,1,I can see how frustrating this must be.
102,0,"Yes, what's wrong?"
102,1,"Oh, I see."
102,2,"Alright, alright, I'm coming."
103,0,I'm glad you're enjoying it.
103,1,"Wow, that must have been an amazing experience."
103,2,"Yeah, it was an incredible experience."
103,3,"Wow, that must have been incredible."
103,4,"Oh wow, that must have been an amazing experience."
103,5,That sounds amazing.
103,6,"Oh, you do?"
103,7,That sounds absolutely amazing.
104,0,"Thank you, we're very happy."
104,1,"Oh, I see."
105,0,We're here for you.
105,1,I'm here.
106,0,That sounds like a lot to navigate.
106,1,I understand this must be a lot to process.
106,2,That must be so confusing and difficult.
106,3,I understand this must be hard to hear.
106,4,I understand this must be difficult.
106,5,"Oh, honey."
107,0,I just can't.
107,1,I can only imagine how much you must be hurting.
107,2,I can only imagine how hard it must be.
107,4,I promise.
107,5,I understand how much Chi Chi meant to you.
107,6,"I miss her, too."
107,7,"I'm sorry you're having a hard time, Phoebe."
107,8,I'm glad you see it that way.
107,9,"Oh, wow, that's... incredible!"
107,10,"It's okay, I understand."
108,0,That's incredibly special.
108,1,"I know, right?"
108,2,I'm so glad I could help.
108,3,"It's been really tough, hasn't it?"
108,4,"That's wonderful, I'm so glad it worked out."
108,5,I told him I was really struggling with my workload and feeling overwhelmed.
108,6,"That's wonderful to hear, I'm so glad things are looking up!"
109,0,"I'm not comfortable with that, and I won't participate."
109,1,"Oh, honey, are you feeling uncomfortable with that?"
109,3,I understand it's a sensitive topic.
109,4,I understand how much that means to you.
109,5,That must have been quite a unique experience for you.
109,6,"Oh, honey, that must be disappointing."
109,7,That must be so disappointing.
109,8,It's awful when someone you care about seems unaffected by your situation.
109,9,"I know, it stings to see him happy while you're stuck here."
109,10,I understand you're feeling down right now.
109,11,It sounds like you're feeling a bit down.
109,12,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.
109,13,It sounds like you're feeling really down right now.
109,14,I hope it does.
109,15,"I understand, sometimes you just need to be alone."
109,16,"It's okay, you don't have to."
109,17,I understand how frustrating that can be.
109,18,"Oh honey, I feel you."
109,19,It's been a while since we talked last.
109,20,"I know, it’s a lot."
109,21,"I'm so sorry, sweetie."
110,0,"Oh, so you're really picking up on the nutmeg, huh?"
110,1,"Yes, I do."
110,2,"Oh, I see."
110,3,"Ouch, I can see how that would sting."
110,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
110,5,"It was terrible, actually."
111,0,You're very welcome!
111,1,You're welcome.
111,2,That's great!
111,3,"I'm a little taken aback, yeah."
111,4,Okay.
111,5,"Oh, I'm so sorry, that must have been really frustrating."
111,6,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that; it must have been really disappointing."
111,7,I’m really sorry to hear that.
111,8,"Yeah, it’s happened to me."
111,9,"Oh man, that must have been rough."
111,10,I just went home and watched TV.
111,11,Oh.
111,12,"Oh man, that sounds tough."
111,13,I'm not going to hurt you.
111,14,I'm just trying to have fun.
111,15,Ouch.
111,16,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel that way."
111,17,"Alright, alright, I'm going, just chill."
112,0,I can't believe they kept that from you.
112,1,I'm just so hurt and confused right now.
112,2,I understand how frustrating that must be.
112,3,I understand you feel frustrated.
112,4,I understand how that would feel like a violation of your space.
113,0,I understand your worry.
113,1,I know this is hard.
113,2,I know it's hard.
113,3,I just don't want him to be lonely.
113,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
113,5,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really tough."
113,6,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly upsetting."
113,7,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to handle."
113,8,I'm glad I can help.
113,9,I can do that.
113,10,It's okay; I understand.
114,0,What is it?
114,1,That sounds really exciting!
114,2,That sounds disappointing.
114,3,That sounds like it would be really fun.
114,4,That sounds like a lot of fun!
115,0,I'm just feeling really lost right now.
115,1,"Oh no, that's terrible, I'm so sorry."
115,2,"I know, I just... I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
115,3,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
115,4,"I understand you're frustrated, but please, there has to be something we can do."
115,5,I understand you're frustrated.
115,6,I understand you're frustrated.
115,7,I can see you're really upset.
116,0,"Yeah, I guess it is."
116,1,"Yeah, it's a lot to process, I guess."
116,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds really disappointing."
116,3,"Yeah, I'm pretty bummed out about it."
116,4,That's a bummer.
116,5,That sounds really disappointing.
116,6,"Yeah, but that’s what he says."
116,7,That sounds stressful.
117,0,What's making you hesitant?
117,1,I'm still not sure.
117,2,"I understand, it's okay to not be ready."
117,3,"I understand, it's okay to feel that way."
118,0,That's really kind of you.
118,1,I just feel so used.
118,2,That must be a really difficult position to be in.
118,3,I know it sounds bad.
118,4,I understand how frustrating that must be.
118,5,I can see how frustrating that must be.
119,0,It's okay to feel that way.
119,1,I'm sorry you feel that way.
119,2,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
119,3,I can see you're hurting.
119,4,It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless about this.
119,5,Because I'm too shy to even say hi.
119,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
119,7,You must really want to meet her.
119,8,That must be so frustrating.
119,9,You sound pretty sure of yourself.
119,10,You sound really frustrated.
119,11,"I'm sorry, that must be so frustrating."
119,12,"It's frustrating when you think you've got it all figured out, isn't it?"
120,0,"I know, it's a huge risk."
120,1,"Okay, but what if you're wrong?"
120,2,"No, I don't!"
120,3,"I'm just worried about you, that's all."
120,4,Yes!
120,7,"Okay, here we go."
120,8,"I'm right here with you, and we've got this."
120,9,Here we go.
120,10,"Oh, wow, that's a tough one!"
120,11,"Oh, Monica."
120,12,I’m so proud of you!
120,13,"Oh, that's right."
120,14,"Oh, come on, you're doing great!"
120,15,I have no idea.
121,0,I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
121,1,"I don't know, guys, I just... I don't think I can."
121,2,I just want to feel like I belong.
121,4,I know it's disappointing.
121,5,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
121,6,You okay?
121,7,"It’s okay, I understand."
122,0,That must feel a little isolating.
122,1,"I hear you, it's tough feeling like you're missing out."
122,2,That sounds like a great opportunity.
122,3,"Oh, that's so thoughtful of you."
122,4,I know how you feel; it's tough wanting to find someone.
122,5,"I know, it's tough out there."
122,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
122,7,"I know, it’s not exactly ideal, is it?"
122,8,"Ouch, that stings."
122,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was that bad."
122,10,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
122,11,"I'm just trying to get back in the game, and I feel a bit lost."
122,12,It sounds like you're feeling a bit conflicted about this.
122,13,"I'm sorry, that does sound a bit rough."
122,14,It sounds like you're not feeling very optimistic about this.
122,15,You seem a little conflicted.
123,0,That's interesting!
123,1,I can understand why that would frustrate you.
123,2,"Oh, so you're feeling frustrated?"
123,3,"Oh my, that sounds...unpleasant."
123,4,I can see why you wouldn't find that funny.
123,5,I can see why you wouldn't find it funny.
123,6,I understand why you're upset about that.
123,7,I'm really hurt that you did that.
123,8,"Oh no, that sounds really frustrating."
123,9,I'm really upset about this.
123,10,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize this was upsetting you so much."
124,0,"I love you too, and I'm already counting down the days."
124,1,"I don't know, but I'm excited to find out with you."
124,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds really interesting!"
124,3,I can see how you might think that.
124,4,That must bring back a lot of memories.
124,5,"Oh, wow, that must have been scary!"
124,6,I understand. It's hard to leave a place with so many memories.
124,7,I'm really sorry you're not happy about moving.
124,8,It sounds like this move is a tough one for you.
124,9,"I know, it's tough when things feel out of your control."
124,10,You seem conflicted about this decision.
124,11,"Oh, you seem really down about this."
125,0,"Oh, honey, I can see why that would be a worry."
125,1,"Oh honey, I can see why that would be a worry."
125,2,"You seem really upset, I'm sorry."
125,3,You sound really stressed.
125,4,"I'm on the edge of my seat, too."
125,5,You seem a little stressed.
125,6,I'm ready if you are.
125,7,"I'm feeling a bit flustered now, too."
125,8,"Oh, wow, okay, that's… unexpected."
126,0,It sounds like you're really happy!
126,1,...feel okay?
126,2,I hear you.
126,3,You sound really excited!
126,4,It sounds like you're really excited!
126,5,I understand how frustrating that can be.
126,6,I understand.
126,7,I guess I can see how that wouldn't be ideal.
126,8,I understand it must be frustrating to feel cramped like that.
126,9,"It's okay, I understand."
126,10,"It's okay, I understand."
126,11,"It’s okay, it’s alright."
126,12,I understand.
127,0,I don't want to.
127,1,I understand you don't want to.
127,2,I understand you don't want to.
127,3,"I understand, it's scary."
127,4,I don't want to go!
128,0,"Yes, I am."
128,1,Are you okay?
128,2,It feels like it's closing in.
128,3,I'm glad you're enjoying it.
128,4,"No, not at all."
128,5,Are you enjoying this?
128,6,I'm glad you're enjoying this.
128,7,Are you feeling good?
128,8,I'm so glad you're enjoying this.
128,9,I'm glad you're feeling so good.
129,0,That sounds incredibly daunting.
129,1,"Oh, dear, I didn't mean to cause you pain."
129,2,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
129,3,I'm so sorry; that's awful.
129,4,That sounds awful.
129,5,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
129,6,I was supposed to get a promotion.
129,7,That's... awful.
129,8,What?
129,9,That sounds nice.
129,10,I'm so in.
129,11,Because they’re the ones who called him a genius!
129,12,"No, I guess I didn't."
129,13,"Oh, I saw it alright."
129,14,I was fired today.
130,0,Hey! I'm feeling pretty lost right now.
130,1,"Oh man, that's the worst!"
130,2,"Thanks so much, I really appreciate it."
130,3,"Yeah, I get it."
130,4,"Ugh, that’s a real bummer, man."
130,5,"No problem, man."
130,6,"Not much, why?"
130,7,I was just wondering if you wanted to grab a bite after your audition?
130,8,"Wow, that's a pretty big ask, huh?"
130,9,"I understand, it's not really your thing."
130,10,"Whoa, okay, I get it."
130,11,"I understand, it's not ideal."
130,12,"Oh, Rach, I get it, you feel bad for him."
130,13,"I just want him to feel welcome, that’s all."
130,14,"Okay, alright, I'll do it."
130,15,"Thanks, Joey, I appreciate it."
130,16,Yeah.
130,17,"Oh, you’re easily pleased!"
131,0,"Ugh, that's so frustrating when you can't seem to get rid of a bad smell."
131,1,"It's alright, I understand."
131,2,"No, I'm not really."
132,0,"Oh, that's okay, it happens."
132,1,"Oh, you must be disappointed."
132,2,"Oh, wow, you sound a little stressed."
132,3,"No, I'm not."
132,4,It doesn't sound like you're fine.
132,5,I just don't know if I can do this tonight.
132,6,"Okay, I get it."
132,7,"Oh, honey, I can hear the panic in your voice."
132,8,It sounds like you're really not up for it.
132,9,I guess I'm just not myself tonight.
132,10,Bye.
133,0,I know how frustrating that can be.
134,0,Hi there.
135,0,"Yes, I'm here to help."
135,1,I'm so frustrated right now.
135,2,"Oh my goodness, that's a difficult situation to imagine."
135,4,Oh my goodness.
135,5,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
135,6,"Oh no, that's awful!"
135,7,"Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that."
135,8,"Oh, my goodness, I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been."
136,0,Hi there.
136,1,"That's alright, no worries."
136,2,Is something wrong?
136,4,"Okay, Professor Geller."
136,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
137,0,Good evening.
137,1,"Good evening, Mr. Geller."
137,2,"Oh, wow, congratulations!"
137,3,"I understand, it's tough."
137,4,"Oh, wow, that's... quite a choice."
137,5,I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must be.
137,6,I'm really not feeling great right now.
137,7,You seem really comfortable in your own skin.
138,0,I'm all ears.
138,1,"Oh, wow, I can only imagine how much that must have hurt."
138,2,I can only imagine how freeing that must feel.
138,3,I'm ready.
138,4,"I'm ready to listen, no matter what it is."
138,5,"Oh, wow, that must have been hard to admit."
138,6,"Oh, Monica, I can see how shocking that must be."
138,7,I can't believe you heard that.
138,8,"Oh, Monica, I can only imagine how betrayed you must feel."
138,9,Is that why you guys haven't been around lately?
138,10,"I'm so sorry, I can see how much pain this is causing you."
138,11,"Oh, Rach, that must have been incredibly overwhelming."
138,12,"Oh, Monica, I am so sorry."
138,13,"I know, right?"
138,14,"Oh, Monica, I am so sorry."
138,15,"No, nothing."
138,16,"Yes, Monica, I'm still reeling from the shock of this whole thing."
139,0,I can see why that would be frustrating.
139,1,It's frustrating when you're interrupted like that.
139,2,It's frustrating when you feel like you're being unfairly interrupted.
139,3,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process all at once."
139,4,I can see how that would be upsetting.
139,5,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in all at once."
140,0,"Oh, wow, that's a truly difficult choice!"
140,1,"Oh wow, that's a tough position to be in."
140,2,It's alright; I can tell you're feeling bad.
141,0,That must be a huge relief.
141,1,I appreciate you looking out for him.
141,2,I understand it's a difficult situation.
141,3,I understand the pressure you're under.
141,4,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed.
141,5,"I wish I could, but I can't just do that."
141,6,You sound really stressed.
141,7,...do to get a break around here?
142,0,Hi Julie!
142,1,"It's nice to hear from you, Julie!"
143,0,"Yes, there is."
143,1,"Oh, that sounds exciting!"
143,2,That sounds really disappointing.
143,3,"That's a real bummer, missing out on the games."
143,4,"I hear you, it's frustrating to miss out."
144,0,"Yeah, I'm really struggling with something right now."
144,1,I'm here to listen if you want to talk.
144,2,Oh.
144,3,"Wow, that must feel overwhelming."
144,4,"Yeah, it sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed."
144,5,You're feeling overwhelmed?
145,0,It sounds like something unexpected happened.
145,1,That sounds really upsetting.
145,2,That sounds really tough.
145,3,"I don't know, I just felt like I had to!"
145,4,It sounds like something upsetting just happened.
145,5,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
145,6,That sounds really frustrating.
145,7,That must be frustrating.
145,8,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
145,9,I can't believe he's still there.
145,10,It's really unsettling to feel like you're being watched.
145,11,That's so creepy.
145,12,I can understand why that would be unsettling.
145,13,I can imagine how unsettling that must be.
145,14,"Like, just be myself?"
145,15,"Oh wow, I can see how that would make you feel really self-conscious."
145,16,"It makes you feel self-conscious, doesn't it?"
145,17,"That sounds... freeing, and also a little nerve-wracking."
145,18,I'm just trying to picture it.
146,0,That's frustrating when you're just waiting and waiting.
146,1,I understand how that could feel.
146,2,I know it's hard to wait.
146,3,I'm just trying to understand.
146,4,"It's just, it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it?"
146,5,It's okay to admit it.
146,6,"It's hard, isn't it?"
146,7,"Okay, so what are you waiting for?"
146,8,It’s just… hard.
146,9,"It's hard, isn't it?"
146,10,"It's hard, isn't it?"
146,11,"That sounds incredibly painful, Phoebe."
146,12,"It must have been so special, and now it's just gone."
147,0,"Oh, that's a bummer, I was looking forward to seeing Monica."
147,1,"I don't know, maybe not."
147,2,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.
147,3,I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
147,4,"I understand your hesitation, it can be a little nerve-wracking."
147,5,I'm not so sure about that.
147,6,It sounds like you're starting to feel a little nervous.
147,7,You think I haven't considered that?
147,8,I guess I'm just a little nervous for you.
147,9,I guess I can see how this feels a little…sudden.
147,10,You really want to make a good impression.
147,11,"It's just that I'm a little nervous, too."
148,0,That sounds really frustrating.
148,1,"That really doesn't seem fair, I'm sorry."
148,2,I understand your frustration; it's not fair.
148,3,"I'm just really frustrated right now, I guess."
148,4,I can see why you'd be frustrated.
148,5,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe you found out that way."
148,6,I can see why you'd be upset about that.
148,7,I'm still really not happy about this.
148,8,"I mean, I'm sorry if I ruined your table."
148,9,I'm really not sure about that.
148,10,I can see why you'd be hesitant.
148,11,"I don't know, it's just a big step, you know?"
148,12,I can see why you'd be hesitant.
148,13,"No, but I'm just saying, it's a lot to think about."
148,14,Then what's the problem?
148,15,Of course.
148,16,"Oh, that sounds like it was really tough."
148,17,"Yeah, that was rough."
148,18,"Oh, wow, that sounds really tough."
148,19,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a real mess."
148,20,"I'm just trying to understand how you feel, that's all."
149,0,Have a wonderful time!
149,1,"That's so sweet, but I really must go."
149,2,"Okay, I understand."
149,3,That's so sweet of you to say.
150,0,"It's alright, what happened?"
150,1,I'm so relieved.
150,2,I understand you're incredibly upset.
150,3,I can see you're really upset.
151,0,That must feel like a huge weight off your shoulders.
151,1,"Okay, if you're sure."
151,2,That sounds like it will make you happy.
151,3,I'm really happy that I could make you happy.
151,6,I can see how that would be overwhelming.
151,7,I don't know... I just feel so...confused.
151,8,"I'm so sorry, this must be a lot to process."
151,9,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
151,10,"It’s just so much to take in, isn’t it?"
151,11,It’s just…a lot to process.
151,12,I didn't mean to dismiss your feelings.
151,13,It's just…a lot.
151,15,"I understand, it's a lot to take in."
151,16,I know this is a lot to take in.
151,17,I can't believe I'm doing this!
152,0,What's wrong?
152,1,"It's okay, we all make mistakes."
152,4,"It was really tough, honestly."
152,5,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly difficult."
152,6,"Oh, wow... I can only imagine how difficult that must be."
152,7,"Oh, wow."
152,8,"I was desperate, okay?"
152,9,"It's okay, I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her."
152,10,"It's alright, we all make mistakes."
152,11,"It's okay, Barry, we've all been there."
153,0,"Okay, I understand."
153,1,"Okay, if you're sure."
153,2,I'm so glad you're feeling better.
153,3,"I'm not sure, I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed right now."
153,4,It sounds like you're not that excited about it.
153,5,I just needed some air.
153,6,It's just that I'm a little nervous.
153,7,"Oh, is it broken?"
153,8,"Oh, that's frustrating."
153,9,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
153,10,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
153,11,I just thought I'd try something new.
153,12,This is ridiculous.
154,0,"I know, right? It's the best feeling."
154,1,"I understand, it sounds like you're feeling a lot right now."
154,2,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
154,3,I can't believe you would say that.
154,4,I can see you're really upset.
154,5,"I'm so sorry, this is really awful."
154,6,"I'm so sorry, I had no idea."
154,7,I'm so sorry you had to wait for so long.
154,8,"Oh, hey, Ross."
155,0,"Yeah, it's me."
155,1,I'm just feeling really lost right now.
155,2,"Oh, hey Mona! How are you?"
155,3,I was hoping we could talk.
155,4,How are you?
155,5,"I'm doing okay, but I've been better."
155,6,"Oh, wow, I am so sorry."
155,7,"Oh, are you asking me out?"
155,8,Great! What day works for you?
155,9,I’m so glad!
155,10,Okay.
155,11,"Thank you, Ross, that's very thoughtful."
155,12,Is everything alright?
156,0,"Oh, wow, that must have taken a lot of courage."
156,1,I understand this is difficult for you.
156,2,"I just know, okay?"
156,3,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
156,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
156,5,"I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly overwhelming."
156,6,I can't believe this is really happening.
156,7,"Okay, here we go."
156,8,"Yeah, I guess I am."
156,9,"I'm right here, I got you."
156,10,I can't believe I'm actually doing this.
156,11,I know this is hard.
157,0,"You're very welcome, I'm happy to share them."
157,1,"That means a lot, really."
157,2,It makes me happy to hear you say that.
158,1,I understand how confusing that must be.
158,2,I'm really scared to look.
158,3,"Okay, I understand."
158,4,I am so scared.
158,6,I understand you don't want to.
158,7,What is it?
158,8,I can see you're a little freaked out right now.
159,0,I'm so glad you feel that way!
159,1,"I know, right?"
159,2,"Oh, I get it now."
159,3,That must have felt amazing.
159,4,"No, he didn't."
159,5,"He does, doesn't he?"
159,6,He really does.
159,7,That sounds like such a wonderful feeling!
159,8,It really is!
159,9,I'm so happy for you!
160,0,Hey.
160,1,I'm not feeling so great.
160,2,How are you feeling today?
160,3,Hey.
160,4,What's on your mind?
160,5,"Oh no, I'm so sorry."
160,6,I'm so sorry.
160,7,"Oh, no, that's not good."
160,8,"Oh, honey, I know how frustrating this must be."
160,10,I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling so burnt out.
160,11,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that."
160,12,"I'm really sorry, Ross."
160,13,I'm really sorry to hear that.
160,14,"I'm sorry, that must be really tough."
160,15,I'm really going to miss you too.
160,16,It's hard to say goodbye.
160,17,"Yeah, I'm really going to miss you."
160,18,"It's going to be different, isn't it?"
161,0,"Hey, how are you doing?"
161,1,"Whoa, that's a long time."
161,2,I'm here for you.
161,3,"Oh, that's too bad."
161,4,"Oh man, that sounds stressful."
161,5,It's hard to feel that way about someone.
162,0,"Oh, thank you, I'm so glad to hear that."
162,1,Are you feeling a bit lost?
163,0,"Oh, honey, that must be so incredibly painful to realize."
163,1,"Oh, Monica, I'm so sorry."
163,2,"Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot lately."
163,3,"Oh, wow."
163,4,"Yeah, it's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
163,5,"Oh, honey."
163,6,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
163,7,"I know, it’s a lot to take in."
163,8,I can't believe he's being so difficult right now.
163,9,"Oh, honey, this is a lot to take in."
163,10,"This is a lot to take in, isn't it?"
164,0,"Wow, really?"
164,1,Oh wow.
164,2,"I'm sorry, I can see how that might sting."
164,3,Oh.
164,4,I'm sorry.
164,5,Wow.
164,6,"Yes, sometime."
164,7,"I'm just a little surprised, that's all."
164,8,I'm glad you're feeling a little more open to the idea.
164,9,I think I'd like that.
165,0,That's understandable; wanting to make someone else happy can be a really rewarding feeling.
165,1,"Thank you, that means a lot."
165,2,"Yes, you are."
165,3,"It was on sale, and I had a bit saved up."
165,4,I can see how that would be tempting.
165,5,I'm just so glad I could do it.
165,6,I'm sure you're a great friend.
165,7,I just thought it would be a nice gesture.
165,8,"That's a big step, and I'm really happy for you."
165,9,"Yeah, that's a big step."
165,10,"Oh, wow, that's a big decision."
165,11,I can see how that would be a tough choice.
165,12,"I get it, you're excited."
165,13,I get that you're excited about Kathy.
165,14,It's tough when you're torn between two people.
165,15,I guess that’s your prerogative.
165,16,Maybe.
165,17,You know I’d be a little jealous.
165,18,I think you'd be a great couple.
165,19,That’s a wonderful feeling!
166,0,What's going on?
166,1,I just feel so lost.
166,2,"Oh, no."
167,0,"I understand, it must be a difficult feeling."
167,1,I feel so exposed right now.
167,2,That's a really fun discovery.
167,3,Me too!
167,4,That's a lot of talent to be impressed by.
167,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit underwhelmed.
167,6,"I am a little jealous, yeah."
167,7,"More, what?"
167,8,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel that way."
167,9,I'm sorry you feel that way.
167,10,You seem a little down.
167,11,"Oh, honey."
167,12,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're feeling a bit down about it."
168,0,Hi there!
168,1,I'm listening.
168,2,"Oh no, how do you think your friend felt about that?"
168,3,"Oh no, that sounds like it might have been a bit much."
168,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot of fun!"
168,5,"Oh, dear."
168,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds really upsetting."
168,7,"Oh, that must have been a relief."
168,8,It sounds like you're really trying to make things better.
168,9,I understand this is upsetting.
168,10,I just feel so humiliated right now.
168,11,I can see why you're upset.
168,12,I feel so embarrassed for you.
168,13,I understand why you feel so upset right now.
168,14,I just feel so humiliated.
169,0,I hear your frustration.
169,1,I... I don't want to talk about that.
169,2,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to deal with."
170,0,"I didn't mean to scare you, I'm so sorry."
170,1,I just don't want you to get hurt.
170,2,I just thought you'd be happy to see me.
170,3,I just wanted to be nice.
170,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was making you uncomfortable."
170,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
170,6,"I'm so sorry, I really didn't mean to upset you."
170,7,I can't believe you thought that.
170,8,"I'm so sorry, I really didn't know."
170,9,"I do like you, but I wasn't expecting this."
170,10,"It's okay, I understand."
170,11,I am so sorry.
171,0,I'm glad you're enjoying it.
171,1,I hear you.
171,2,I'm all ears.
171,3,Take your time.
171,4,I'm here for you.
171,5,I'm listening.
171,6,It must be hard to focus.
171,7,"Oh, no, are you okay?"
172,0,That sounds like a difficult decision to have made.
172,1,"It's okay, I understand."
172,3,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
172,4,I'm so glad you're happy.
172,5,"Oh, that must feel awful."
172,6,You're welcome.
172,7,You're welcome.
172,8,I can't believe you're saying that.
172,10,"Oh, that's rough."
173,0,"I know it's tough, but you can do this."
173,1,"I know, it's a lot of pressure."
173,2,"I know, I'm sorry, this is just stressful."
173,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was missing out on the fun."
173,4,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were so bored."
173,5,"I’m sorry, I was looking forward to this too."
173,6,"I am sorry, I know this is boring."
173,7,I'm just trying to make the best of a bad situation.
173,8,I can't believe you're putting me on the spot like this.
173,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit cornered right now.
174,0,I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
174,1,You're very welcome!
174,2,I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
174,3,"Oh, did I make you feel like I wasn't enjoying myself?"
174,4,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
174,5,I'm a little nervous now.
174,6,"Oh, I see."
174,7,The one playing the panpipes.
175,0,"Yes, we did."
175,1,"Oh, man, I'm so sorry."
175,2,You're very welcome.
175,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds... underwhelming."
175,4,I know it's not ideal.
175,5,It's just... a lot to take in.
175,6,"Oh, honey."
175,7,I'm so sorry.
175,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds rough."
175,9,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly painful."
175,10,That sounds incredibly painful.
175,11,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly painful."
176,0,"Oh, that's just my son, he loves to run around like that."
176,1,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
176,2,I feel so exposed right now.
176,4,They're my family.
176,5,"It's okay, I don't know them either."
176,6,"Oh, wow, that's a really old photo."
176,7,It's so wonderful to see her like that.
176,8,That's so young.
176,9,I wish I knew more about them.
176,10,"Oh, wow, you're really excited about that!"
177,0,I'm really nervous to talk about it.
177,1,"Oh, wow, okay."
177,2,"Oh, wow."
177,3,"Oh honey, are you okay?"
177,4,"I'm so sorry, I know this must be hard."
177,5,I can see how this would be awkward.
177,6,I can see that you’re relieved.
177,7,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
177,8,I understand that this must be difficult to hear.
177,9,I can see how much this means to you.
177,10,"I'm sorry, this is hard."
178,0,"Okay, I'm here."
178,1,"Oh, okay, I see what you mean."
178,2,"Oh no, what happened?"
179,0,It sounds like you're feeling a bit down.
179,1,"Yeah, I am."
179,2,You think so?
179,3,"Oh, that's a shame."
179,4,Close.
179,5,You seem determined to guess!
179,6,Not even close.
179,7,"Oh, you're making me curious!"
179,8,Nope.
179,9,"Oh, cool, I’m happy for you!"
179,10,You sound so relieved.
179,11,I’m just so relieved.
179,12,That must be a relief.
179,13,I promise.
179,14,"I know it’s stressful, but it’ll be okay."
179,15,He does.
179,16,"Okay, good."
179,17,He can.
179,18,What's wrong?
179,19,"It's okay, you're feeling a little down about this, aren't you?"
180,0,Hi there.
180,4,"Honestly, I'm pretty frustrated too."
180,5,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
180,6,That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.
180,7,"Oh, I'm so sorry you're going through that."
180,8,Oh. My. God.
180,9,"Oh my goodness, that sounds incredibly stressful."
180,10,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly challenging."
180,11,This is a lot to process; you must be feeling overwhelmed.
180,12,I...I can't believe this is happening.
180,13,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
180,14,"I'm so sorry, this must be a lot to process."
180,15,"It hurts like hell, yes."
181,0,"Oh, I totally get that feeling of regret when you're still hungry."
181,1,"Oh man, that's a bummer, I'm sorry."
181,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
181,3,It feels pretty frustrating when you're locked out like this.
181,4,That's a pretty frustrating situation.
182,0,"Not much, just feeling a bit overwhelmed lately."
182,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been a really tough thing to see."
182,2,I feel so incredibly hurt right now.
182,3,I understand you're hurting right now.
182,4,"I know, it hurts so much to feel like things were taken from you."
182,5,I know it feels like things are out of your control right now.
182,6,"I know, it's just so frustrating when things don't go the way you expect."
182,7,It just feels like everything is falling apart.
182,8,"It just feels like a betrayal, doesn't it?"
182,9,"It really hurts, doesn't it?"
182,10,I just don't know if I can.
182,11,"It's okay to be a little bit relieved, right?"
182,12,"I know, it's just… it stings, doesn't it?"
182,13,"Okay, that's the spirit."
182,14,Good for you.
182,15,"Okay, if that's what you want."
183,0,Hi there.
183,1,Hey!
183,2,Hey!
183,3,Hi.
183,4,Hi.
183,5,"Thanks, you too."
183,6,I'm glad you think so.
183,7,I'm glad you think so.
183,8,I am.
183,9,"Yeah, it really is."
183,10,"I know, right?"
183,11,I haven't thought about that in ages.
183,12,And here we are.
183,13,I'm so glad.
183,14,I missed you too.
183,15,I'll be here.
183,16,"I missed you, too."
183,17,I'm here.
183,18,What's wrong?
183,19,You're nervous.
184,0,"Oh, hey Jane! That's so great to hear!"
184,1,"Of course, I'd be happy to!"
184,2,"Of course, I'll text it to you right now."
184,3,"No problem, I will call you right now."
184,4,"Wow, you sound excited!"
184,5,"Not much, just a little stressed about the party."
184,6,"Oh, that is disappointing."
184,7,I understand; it's disappointing when you have to miss something you'd enjoy.
184,8,"I understand, it's disappointing to miss out on fun things."
184,9,"Oh, wow, you must be really disappointed."
184,10,I can hear your frustration.
184,11,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
184,12,It's so disappointing when you miss out on something you're looking forward to.
184,13,"I know, it's tough when you have to miss out on things you want to do."
184,14,That must be so disappointing for you.
184,15,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
184,16,It sounds like you're feeling pretty down on yourself right now.
184,17,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it was that bad."
184,18,"Wow, that stings."
184,19,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
184,20,I can't believe you'd do that.
184,21,I am so sorry!
185,0,It's from an old friend.
185,1,"Oh, that's thoughtful of him."
185,2,That's really sweet.
185,3,He remembered my birthday.
185,4,"Wow, that's so sweet."
185,5,That's so sweet.
185,6,That's so sweet.
185,7,That's so sweet.
185,8,He really does care.
185,9,"He really does care, doesn't he?"
185,10,"He's always been a romantic, hasn't he?"
185,11,"Oh, I'm so sorry; I didn't mean to bring that up."
185,12,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
185,13,I'm so sorry.
186,0,"Me too, it's the best part of my day."
186,1,"Me too, I wish we could."
186,2,"Me too, it sounds like a dream."
186,3,That sounds like a perfect start to the day.
186,4,What's wrong?
186,5,What's wrong?
187,0,"Oh no, that sounds like a letdown."
187,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
187,2,Hi Bonnie!
187,3,"Yes, I am."
187,4,I just... I can't believe it.
187,5,"It's okay, I understand how that could be a little jarring."
187,6,"Oh wow, that must feel really different."
187,7,"Yeah, I can imagine that would make a big difference."
187,8,"Thank you, I will."
187,9,I'm glad we could clear up any confusion.
188,0,I can see why you would.
188,2,That must be a relief.
188,3,I understand your need to protect yourself.
188,4,I feel like you're blaming me.
188,5,I can see you're feeling frustrated.
188,6,You sound frustrated.
189,0,I understand your worry; that would be so unsettling.
189,1,I'm so worried about him.
189,2,I understand your worry.
189,3,"Oh, you poor thing, that sounds awful."
189,4,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
189,5,"Oh, thank goodness, I was so worried!"
189,6,I was so worried.
189,7,I was so worried!
189,8,I can tell you were really worried about him.
189,9,I was worried sick!
189,10,You had us really worried.
189,12,"I am so happy for you, but also, I'm so worried."
189,13,You seem really upset.
189,14,I can see you're really excited about this.
189,15,"Oh, wow, that sounds like it was rough."
190,0,I'm glad you think so.
190,1,You guys make *what*?
190,2,I'm glad you think so.
190,3,You okay?
190,4,That's a lot to think about.
190,5,"It's a little scary, isn't it?"
190,6,That must feel amazing.
190,7,I understand this is a big step.
191,0,"Whoa, okay, I didn't mean to get so close."
191,1,"Seriously, it's brand new!"
191,2,"I'm doing okay, just a little preoccupied."
191,3,"It's a beautiful car, isn't it?"
191,4,That must be a great feeling.
191,5,"Aww, I bet she looks beautiful."
191,6,That sounds like fun!
192,0,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
192,1,I'm so sorry to hear that.
192,2,"Oh, that must have been so difficult."
192,3,I understand that you're feeling hurt and overlooked.
192,4,That must have been a difficult choice to make.
192,5,"I understand, it must be tough to process all of this."
192,6,I can see you're really happy about it.
192,7,"I understand, it must be a lot to process."
193,0,I'm so sorry you're being treated that way.
193,1,Thanks!
193,2,"It really is, isn't it?"
193,3,That's a really good idea!
193,4,It sounds like you're really not into that idea.
193,5,I don't think I could do that.
193,6,I can hear your disappointment.
193,7,It's hard when you feel like your art is being undervalued.
194,0,"It's okay, I understand."
194,1,"Oh no, I can already tell this is going to be rough."
195,0,"Yes, please, I'm trying to understand."
195,1,"Yes, I believe that is correct, sir."
195,2,It sounds like you've got your work cut out for you.
195,3,I understand it can be frustrating when you're particular about your coffee.
195,4,I'm sorry you feel that way.
195,5,I understand.
195,6,You must be really tired.
195,7,"I know, right?"
195,8,"I know, right?"
195,9,"Yeah, I probably would."
195,10,"It's hard to resist a celebrity crush, isn't it?"
195,11,I can't believe you said that.
195,12,"It's just a little intimidating, right?"
195,13,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that."
195,14,"Ouch, that stings."
195,15,You really think I'd be okay with that?
195,16,"You really would, wouldn't you?"
195,17,"You know, I wouldn't mind being an alternate."
195,18,"I know, right?"
195,19,I can’t believe you're actually doing this!
196,0,I understand.
196,1,I just need some space right now.
196,2,I understand wanting to move and have fun.
197,0,I'm so glad you feel that way.
197,1,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
197,2,"Oh, Joey, you startled me!"
197,3,"I doubt it, but I just thought I'd say hello."
197,4,"I'm sorry, I don't recognize you."
197,5,I'm glad you remember.
197,6,I get that.
197,7,Are you okay?
198,0,That's wonderful to hear.
198,1,Okay.
198,2,You're welcome.
198,3,I'm glad I could help.
198,4,"Oh, no, what's wrong?"
198,5,I can see that would be frustrating.
198,6,"I know, it's so frustrating when it feels like you're stuck."
199,0,It sounds like you feel bad about that.
199,1,We just want you to be comfortable.
199,2,I'm so glad to hear that!
199,3,That's wonderful!
199,4,It was for the local animal shelter.
199,5,"Oh, I can see that's a little vague."
199,6,It's wonderful that you were able to contribute to such a worthy cause.
199,7,Hey!
199,8,"Oh no, what did he say?"
199,9,"Oh, wow!"
199,10,This is so awkward.
199,11,"I know, right?"
200,0,"No, not really, I don't think so."
200,1,"Oh, that's really disappointing to hear."
200,2,"I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
200,3,That's so disappointing.
200,4,"I understand, that's really frustrating."
200,5,It’s so frustrating when someone lets you down.
200,6,That sounds like a good plan.
200,7,That sounds like a plan.
200,8,"Yeah, I think that might work."
200,9,"Good, I'm glad you agree!"
201,0,"Yes, doorknob."
201,1,"Oh, yeah, I'm listening."
201,2,I'm glad you're interested.
201,3,"I understand, it's okay to take things slow."
201,4,I understand.
201,5,I understand.
201,6,"Oh, wow."
201,7,"Oh, wow, okay."
201,8,"Oh, wow."
201,9,I can see how that might be a little frustrating.
202,0,Hey there.
202,1,I feel really lost.
202,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly stressful."
202,3,I'm so sorry to hear that.
202,4,That sounds incredibly stressful.
202,5,I can only imagine how overwhelming that must feel.
202,6,That's such a relief.
202,7,I don't even know where to begin...
202,8,You must be so relieved.
202,9,I'm so sorry.
202,12,You must be so overwhelmed right now.
202,13,"You did a great job, and that's what matters."
202,14,I can't wait!
202,15,"I don’t know, but I’m excited to find out!"
202,16,I can't believe this is happening.
203,0,"Oh wow, that's so exciting!"
203,1,"Yes, feel!"
203,2,"Oh man, I wish I could!"
203,3,It was just a little bit ago.
203,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been an amazing moment."
203,5,"Oh, that must have been so sweet."
204,0,I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that right now.
204,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been so intense."
204,2,"Wow, that must have been incredibly difficult."
204,3,I'm ready.
204,4,I miss you so much.
204,5,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry to hear that."
204,6,It must be so hard to make that decision alone.
204,7,I'm so sorry to hear you say that.
204,8,It sounds like you're really trying to make a fresh start.
204,9,It sounds like you're really trying to make a new life for yourself.
204,10,"I'm so sorry, that must be so hard."
204,11,I'm here for you.
204,12,It sounds like you're trying to find your place.
204,13,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck.
205,0,"That would be so great, thank you!"
205,1,"Of course, we can make that happen."
205,2,That would be really nice.
205,3,I know how much that means to you.
205,4,I can't believe this is happening.
205,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit relieved.
205,6,It sounds like you're really touched by them.
206,0,"Yes, my son."
206,1,"Oh, I see."
206,2,"Oh, that must have been so confusing and frustrating for you."
206,3,It sounds like this is all very confusing and upsetting.
206,4,"Oh, no, that sounds awful!"
206,5,"Oh, I am so sorry."
206,6,"Oh, you poor thing, let me help."
206,7,That sounds really frustrating.
206,8,It sounds like you're really frustrated and upset right now.
206,9,I understand this is hard.
206,10,Because I'm the one with the leg cramps!
206,11,I'm so sorry; this is really hard.
206,12,I'm so sorry you're feeling this way.
206,13,"I'm sorry, that sounds incredibly uncomfortable."
206,14,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
206,15,I'm so sorry you're going through this.
206,16,"I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly frustrating."
206,17,I'm so sorry.
206,18,"It's okay, I understand you're frustrated right now."
207,0,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you're feeling embarrassed and a little mortified right now."
207,1,"Oh dear, I am so sorry, I didn't mean to say that!"
207,2,I can see why that might be a bit mortifying.
207,3,"Oh, wow, you must be mortified!"
207,4,"Oh, honey, I can see that you're a little flustered right now."
207,5,I didn't?
207,6,I think you're a little flustered right now.
207,7,"Oh, that's a relief."
207,8,I can see why you'd find that interesting.
207,9,I'm all ears.
207,10,I can see you're trying to be charming.
207,11,"Oh, that's so sweet!"
207,12,"No, but I do like to cook."
207,13,"That sounds like a lot of work, but exciting too."
207,14,"It's exciting and a little scary, isn't it?"
207,15,I'm just trying to find a quiet corner to think.
207,16,"I understand, it can be frustrating when a conversation is interrupted."
207,17,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
207,18,I just want to enjoy my dinner with my friends.
207,19,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting."
208,0,"Oh no, that's so frustrating after all that work!"
208,1,"Ugh, that's the worst feeling ever."
208,2,I remember how frustrating that felt.
208,3,"Oh, man, that would have been so frustrating."
208,4,I was really disappointed I didn't get to capture that bird.
208,5,It sounds like you're really disappointed.
208,6,"Oh no, that's the worst!"
208,7,"Oh, that's a bummer, I'm so sorry!"
208,8,"Oh, that's a bummer, let's get those pants off quickly then."
208,9,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
208,10,"I'm sorry, that sucks."
208,11,What happened?!
208,12,"I know, right?"
208,14,"It's alright, I'm sure we can figure something out."
208,15,"I know, right?"
208,16,"I know, right?"
209,0,"Okay, I'm ready."
210,0,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
210,1,"The one I've been looking for forever, of us at the beach."
210,2,"Oh, wow... I understand this must be incredibly upsetting."
210,3,"I'm sorry, I was desperate."
210,4,I can explain everything.
210,5,"I'm so sorry, Vincent."
210,6,"I'm so sorry, Vincent."
210,7,"Yeah, it was really intense."
210,8,I felt it too.
210,9,Thanks.
210,10,"Wow, you seem really down."
211,0,"You can imagine how happy they were, right?"
211,1,I imagine that's a bit daunting.
211,2,It's a big step.
211,3,"It was a bit of a disaster, actually."
211,5,"Wow, that must have been a lot to process."
211,6,"Wow, that must've been a shock."
211,7,That sounds like a pretty stressful time.
211,8,That sounds like it was pretty embarrassing.
211,9,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine how mortifying that was."
211,10,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
211,11,"I know, it's a lot to process."
211,12,"I'm so sorry, Chandler."
211,13,"I'm so sorry, Chandler, I can only imagine how upsetting this is."
211,14,"Oh, honey, that sounds disappointing."
212,0,"Ouch, that sounds painful."
212,1,Ouch!
212,2,"Oh, I bet that felt good!"
212,3,"Oh no, that sounds really painful!"
212,4,"Yes, it definitely wasn't."
212,5,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
212,6,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry!"
212,7,"Ouch, I can imagine that stings!"
212,8,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
212,9,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
213,0,That's completely okay; we all are.
213,1,"That's okay, we all start somewhere."
213,2,I can see you're really excited about this!
213,3,I'm just feeling a bit self-conscious.
213,4,"Oh, that stings, doesn't it?"
214,0,"I know, it's so exciting!"
214,1,"David, my ex!"
214,2,"Oh, wow, that must have been incredibly painful."
214,3,I can't believe he's here.
214,4,I can only imagine how you're feeling right now.
214,5,I can't believe he's here.
214,6,"Phoebe, hi."
214,7,"Oh, so you're back then."
214,8,"It's good to see you too, Phoebe."
214,9,You must be so surprised.
214,10,It must feel so strange seeing each other again after all this time.
215,0,That's so exciting!
216,0,"It's okay, I know you didn't mean for things to go that way."
216,1,I appreciate you saying that.
216,2,"Yeah, it sounds like a lot of people are involved."
217,0,I understand.
218,1,I'm here for you.
218,2,"Yeah, it's a pretty standard practice."
218,3,"Right, so you feel like there's a separation there?"
218,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry to hear that."
218,5,It sounds like that really hurts.
218,6,"I'm sorry, Ross, that sounds really isolating."
218,7,It just feels like I'm always on the outside looking in.
218,8,"Yeah, I get it."
218,9,It just feels like you're on your own sometimes.
218,10,"I get that, man."
218,11,"Yeah, see ya."
218,12,I'm glad you're still feeling included.
219,0,That must have been really embarrassing.
219,1,"I'm sorry, that must have felt embarrassing."
219,2,I guess it's just frustrating to feel like you're singled out.
219,3,"Oh, that's rough, I would have been mortified."
219,4,"Oh, that must have been mortifying for him."
219,5,I guess it's not fun to be the only one.
219,6,"Oh, honey, I can totally relate to having a Thanksgiving that just goes off the rails."
219,7,It was the one where they all knew she was pregnant.
219,8,"It's okay, you don't have to if you don't want to."
219,9,"I understand, it can be hard to talk about painful memories."
219,10,It sounds like you're really dreading this.
219,11,It sounds like you're really dreading bringing up this memory.
219,12,"Okay, I get that this is a really sensitive topic for you."
220,0,Hey there.
220,1,I'm feeling really down today.
220,2,Hey! How are you doing?
220,3,"Oh, honey, no need to apologize."
220,4,It's okay; I understand.
220,5,"It's okay, Phoebe."
220,6,"It's okay, I understand."
221,0,"Yes, it's been incredibly difficult."
221,1,"Oh, wow."
221,2,"It's tough when they're away, isn't it?"
221,3,This is a lot.
221,4,"It's been a lot, hasn't it?"
221,5,"I’m sorry, that sounds really stressful."
222,0,"Oh, wow!"
222,1,"Oh, yeah, I remember Doug."
222,2,He just told me I'm being laid off.
222,3,"Oh wow, that's a huge step, I bet you're feeling a lot right now."
222,4,Thank you.
222,5,"Oh, wow, that's wonderful, I'm so happy for you!"
222,6,I'm glad to hear things are finally looking up for you.
222,7,I suppose you could be right.
222,8,It sounds like you're really happy and relieved.
222,9,That sounds like a great way to celebrate!
222,11,That sounds like a great way to celebrate.
222,12,That sounds incredibly stressful.
222,13,"That sounds stressful, but I'm glad things are going well."
222,14,"I understand, it can be a lot to deal with."
222,15,"I understand, it's been a lot."
222,16,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
222,17,I understand.
222,18,"Oh, wow."
222,19,That sounds like a nightmare.
223,0,"I understand, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
223,1,I'm really sorry you're feeling frustrated right now.
223,2,"Hey, I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated."
223,3,Hey!
223,4,"Oh, you need it back, huh?"
223,5,"Oh, wow, that sounds... unpleasant."
223,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a real mess."
223,7,"Oh, that's a long time to wait."
223,8,"Oh, wow, that sounds really exciting."
223,9,"Oh, so you're feeling a little lonely right now?"
223,10,"Oh, wow, that's a tough one."
223,11,"Oh, come on, I was just trying to be friendly."
223,12,"I'm just feeling a little off today, that's all."
223,13,"I was just hoping we could, y'know, hang out."
223,14,It sounds like you're feeling pretty rejected right now.
224,0,It's... complicated.
224,1,"Nice to meet you, Jake."
224,2,"Yeah, I do."
224,3,"That's awesome, I love the Knicks too!"
224,4,"I'd love to, but I'm not sure if I can."
224,5,"Okay, sounds good, just let me know."
225,0,What's wrong?
225,1,"Yes, I was."
225,2,"Oh no, what happened?"
225,3,I just feel so drained.
225,4,"Oh no, that sounds frustrating."
225,5,"I know, it's the worst when you have to spend money on things like that."
225,6,I’m glad I could help.
225,7,"Oh, Ross, you really shouldn't have."
225,8,"No problem, I know you're stressed."
225,9,I can imagine that was really tough.
225,10,"I know, it's tough."
225,11,That must have been really tough.
226,0,"Yeah, it was... a disaster."
226,1,Thanks! I'm really happy to be here.
226,2,I'm sorry it had to end.
226,3,"Okay, I'll just be here."
226,4,I'm glad you're having fun!
226,5,I guess I misunderstood the invitation then.
226,6,It sounds like things are pretty chaotic right now.
226,7,"Oh, so you're introducing your friend to me?"
226,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
226,9,I can understand why you're feeling that way.
226,10,"I'm a little nervous about this, too."
226,11,What's up with you?
226,12,I can see how that might have come off the wrong way.
226,13,I don't know what you're talking about.
226,17,"I understand, I'll catch you later."
226,18,I think I might need a drink.
226,19,It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated right now.
226,20,I hear you.
226,21,"I know, right?"
227,0,Hey! What's up?
228,0,I understand your frustration.
228,1,"Oh, I understand, it must be hard to admit you were wrong."
228,2,"I understand, and I'm truly sorry for how I acted."
228,3,"I know you're trying, and I appreciate that."
228,4,"Oh, Pheebs, that's really great to hear."
228,5,I'm really happy for you!
228,6,I'm so glad you think so!
228,7,"Oh, man."
229,0,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
229,1,Any time.
229,2,"Goodbye, and thanks again."
229,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot."
229,4,"Oh, wow, you must be feeling incredibly anxious right now."
230,0,That sounds like a really interesting and delicate combination.
230,1,"Oh, thank you, that's so sweet of you to say."
231,0,"Wow, that sounds really intense."
231,1,"Oh no, that sounds stressful."
231,2,"I'm so sorry, that sounds stressful."
231,3,It sounds like you're in a tough spot.
231,4,I understand you're disappointed.
231,5,"I know, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to lighten the mood."
231,6,I really wish I did.
231,7,I understand you're really stressed right now.
231,8,I understand you're really stressed right now.
231,9,I understand you're really frustrated right now.
231,10,"I know you're stressed, but I'm just trying to connect."
231,11,"I just want to spend some time with you, that’s all."
231,12,"I know you're busy, but this feels really important to me."
231,13,I understand you're frustrated and busy right now.
231,14,"I understand, it sounds like you're really stressed."
232,0,"I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep you updated."
232,1,I'm all ears.
232,2,That sounds like a really big deal to consider.
232,3,I didn't mean it like that; I'm sorry if it came off wrong.
232,4,That sounds like a really sensitive topic for you.
232,5,I didn't mean to make you feel that way.
232,6,It sounds like you're worried about something.
232,7,"No, of course not!"
232,8,Are you saying you don't think I'll find someone?
232,9,I didn't mean it like that.
232,10,That sounds terrifying!
232,11,"I'm so sorry, that must have been a shock."
232,12,I'm just trying to look nice.
232,13,"No, I just always look this good."
232,14,You seem nervous.
232,15,"Oh, right, I forgot."
232,16,You seem really worried.
232,17,I just want the best for my baby.
232,18,"Oh, wow, that explains a lot."
232,19,What's going on?
233,0,That's so thoughtful of you!
233,1,"Santa was busy, so he sent me instead."
234,1,I understand you're really desperate.
234,2,I understand how much you want this.
234,3,I understand.
234,4,"I know, it's so frustrating when things don't go as planned."
234,5,What would work?
234,6,I am so sorry you feel that way.
234,8,"I know, it's hard to believe."
234,9,I understand how confusing that must be.
234,10,I think I understand that feeling.
234,11,It's just that you sound so vulnerable right now.
235,0,"Oh, that must have felt so deflating."
235,1,"Yes, and it felt incredibly awkward, I’m not going to lie."
235,2,"Of course, anytime."
235,3,I'm so glad you were there to catch me; I'd have been mortified if I'd fallen!
235,4,I can imagine it must have felt amazing to pull it off.
235,5,You think I'm not as strong anymore?
235,6,"Alright, alright, I get it, you're feeling a bit sensitive about this."
235,7,"Okay, here we go."
235,8,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry."
235,9,"I can’t believe you went through with it, that must have been terrifying."
236,0,Hey there.
236,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot to keep track of!"
236,2,"Oh, wow, you seem really excited about that!"
236,3,I'm glad you feel that way.
236,4,"Oh, wow, that's really kind of you."
236,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was making you feel that way."
236,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was hurting your feelings."
236,7,I'm really sorry.
236,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
236,10,It sounds like you're feeling pretty self-conscious right now.
236,11,I can see how much this is upsetting you.
236,12,I guess I can see how that would feel.
236,13,I just feel like you're not taking me seriously.
236,14,You're welcome.
236,15,I guess I can’t blame you.
237,0,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
237,1,It feels like you're feeling pretty worthless right now.
237,2,It sounds like you're feeling pretty inadequate right now.
237,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit down on yourself right now.
237,4,It sounds like you feel a little dismissed.
237,5,I'm really sorry you feel that way.
237,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like that."
237,7,I'm not sure I follow.
237,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
237,9,"I'm sorry, too."
237,10,"I'm so relieved to hear that, Phoebe."
237,11,I didn't mean to make you feel this way.
238,0,It sounds incredibly frustrating.
238,1,I can't do this anymore.
238,2,That sounds like a lot of work.
238,3,"Alright, I can see how frustrating this is."
238,4,Sounds like you're feeling a bit stressed right now.
238,5,"Okay, I'm with you."
238,6,I can feel the urgency!
239,0,"That's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
239,1,That's a pretty intense thought.
239,2,"That's a pretty overwhelming idea, isn't it?"
239,3,I'm really scared to think about it.
239,4,"It's pretty amazing, isn't it?"
239,5,I'll miss you.
239,6,I can't believe you're leaving me hanging like this!
240,0,"Oh no, that sounds frustrating!"
240,1,"I can't seem to make him understand, no matter how I phrase it."
240,2,I can see how that might be frustrating.
240,3,I can't believe he's not even trying to understand.
240,4,Have a good trip.
240,5,Have a good trip!
240,6,I'm fine with whatever works best for you.
241,0,"Oh, wow, that sounds like it could be really awkward."
241,1,That sounds really uncomfortable.
241,2,"Oh no, what did he say?"
241,3,That must be a relief.
241,4,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
241,5,It sounds like you're feeling really pressured and conflicted right now.
241,6,That sounds incredibly stressful.
241,7,"Ugh, this is so stressful!"
241,8,It sounds like you're feeling really conflicted right now.
241,9,"That sounds really lovely, thanks."
241,10,"It sounds like a plan, but it's still a lot to take on."
241,11,That sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
241,12,"I know, it's like, you're already dreading it."
241,13,I'm just really not in the mood for this whole charade.
242,0,"Oh, Chandler, it's so nice to hear from you!"
242,1,"Oh, wow, that's a bit harsh."
242,2,"Oh, this sounds like it's going to be interesting."
242,3,"Yeah, I can see how it would sting a little."
242,4,I can imagine that was really painful.
242,5,"Yes, I’m so sorry."
242,6,I’m… I’m speechless.
243,0,"Oh, that sounds really frustrating."
243,1,"Oh no, are you alright?"
244,0,Hi!
244,1,Of course.
244,3,"Oh no, that must have been difficult."
244,4,He was really upset.
244,5,"Oh, that must have been tough to hear."
244,6,"Oh, wow, that must feel really conflicting right now."
245,0,What's on your mind?
245,1,That sounds really lovely.
245,2,I can see why you'd feel that way.
245,3,I can only imagine how exciting that must have been.
245,4,"No, he didn't."
245,5,"Oh, wow."
245,6,"Oh, I am so happy for you!"
245,7,"Aww, I can see how excited you are."
245,8,"It's the best feeling, isn't it?"
245,9,"Oh honey, don't say that."
245,10,I'm just so happy for you.
245,11,"You’re right, it’s a whole different kind of ache."
245,12,"I know, it's the worst."
245,13,"It's such a wonderful, scary feeling, isn't it?"
245,14,"It's hard to let go of those things, isn't it?"
245,15,It must be so bittersweet.
245,16,I don’t want a last kiss.
246,0,"Of course, I'm happy to help."
246,1,I understand that it could have been a difficult situation.
246,2,"Okay, I'm listening."
246,3,"I appreciate you saying that, it means a lot."
246,4,"It really wasn’t that hard, I just kept my cool."
246,5,I understand it's hard to focus right now.
246,6,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
247,0,I'm really looking forward to a good meal too.
247,1,"Oh, no, I am so sorry!"
247,2,"Oh honey, I can see you're stressed."
248,0,I understand.
248,1,I understand.
248,3,"I know, right?"
248,4,I can see how upsetting that must be.
248,5,I know how frustrating that can be.
248,6,That must feel really good for you right now.
248,7,I can see how that would be frustrating.
249,0,"Oh, that must have been so difficult."
249,1,"Oh, honey, I can see how that would be hard to watch."
249,2,"I understand, it can be a real hassle."
249,3,"I know, it's just that it's so much effort."
249,4,I can see how that would be disappointing.
249,5,"It's just not the same, is it?"
249,6,"I understand, it's hard to imagine Thanksgiving without all the traditional fixings."
249,7,"Oh, you're really set on this turkey, aren't you?"
249,8,I know I can be a bit overzealous sometimes.
249,9,"Wow, you are really excited about this turkey!"
249,10,"Oh, wow, you're really excited about this turkey!"
249,11,I am so very happy you feel that way!
249,13,I'm so glad you feel that way!
250,0,That's exciting!
250,1,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
250,2,"I know, right? It makes such a difference."
250,3,...the parking lot.
250,4,"Oh, wow..."
250,5,"Oh, that's... unexpected."
250,6,I can see why you'd say hi.
251,0,"Of course, I can help you with that."
251,1,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it."
251,2,"Yes, that's the right one."
251,3,I am so frustrated right now!
251,4,I'm right here with you.
251,5,I'm here to help you.
251,6,You've got this!
252,0,"I'm sorry, I can't tell you that."
252,1,"Oh, so it's not what I was expecting?"
252,2,"Yes, it is Marcel."
252,3,"Oh, you must be so excited to talk about Marcel!"
252,4,"No, he's generally very peaceful."
252,5,That must be a relief.
252,6,I understand your concern.
252,7,"I'm just a little worried, that's all."
252,8,You seem worried about Marcel.
252,9,I'm just trying to get a sense of what he's like.
252,10,"I'm starting to get a little worried, to be honest."
252,13,I understand your concern.
252,14,"Oh no, that's awful!"
252,15,"Oh no, that sounds awful."
252,16,"Oh, no."
252,17,"Oh, that must be so exciting!"
252,18,"I know, I know, I'm just so excited for him."
252,19,I don't think that's a good idea.
253,0,You're welcome.
253,1,I'm glad it worked out for you.
253,2,"Oh, Janice, that must have felt a little embarrassing."
253,3,"No, I'm here."
253,4,"Oh, thank goodness."
253,5,"Oh, that must be a huge relief."
253,6,I'm so sorry; that must be incredibly difficult.
253,7,"Oh, wow, that's intense."
253,8,That's a huge relief!
253,9,I can understand why you'd be feeling that way.
253,10,"It's understandable to feel that way, after all you've been through."
253,11,"I'm sure it will be, but it's understandable to be nervous."
254,0,"I can't find it anywhere, and I'm starting to panic."
254,1,"Oh honey, what's wrong?"
254,2,I just want it back.
254,3,I'm not going to let you have it.
254,4,I just really need it right now.
254,5,"Please, Phoebe, let's just talk about this."
254,6,I just want to see it.
254,7,I'm sorry you're upset.
254,8,You seem really upset.
254,9,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
255,0,I can only imagine how confusing and unsettling that must be.
255,1,I'm so sorry; that must be incredibly jarring.
255,2,"I'm so sorry, I understand this is a lot to take in."
255,3,"I'm so sorry, I just assumed."
255,4,I wasn't.
255,5,I understand.
255,6,"I'm so sorry, I understand how bad this is."
255,7,"Oh, Ethan..."
255,8,"I know, it's probably a terrible time to say it."
255,9,I just... I don't know what to say.
255,10,I'm trying.
255,11,"I know, and I'm sorry."
255,12,"I know, this is a mess."
255,13,I'm not sure what that means.
255,14,I'm so sorry.
255,15,"Oh, honey."
256,0,I know how frustrating that must be.
256,1,I'm starting to feel a little claustrophobic.
256,2,"I'm so sorry, I know how much you want this."
256,3,I just want this to be over.
256,4,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
256,5,"That would be ideal, wouldn't it?"
256,6,"Oh, honey, I can hear how much you just want to escape."
256,7,"I'm so sorry, this must be really hard."
256,8,"It's awful, isn't it, when it feels like it'll never end?"
256,9,"I'm so sorry, I can only imagine."
256,10,"Of course, I'm on it."
256,11,"I'm sorry, it's alright."
256,12,I'm so sorry.
256,13,"I am so sorry, I can only imagine how you must be feeling."
256,14,"I'm so sorry, this must be awful."
256,15,I just want this to be over.
257,0,It sounds like you're trying to reassure yourself.
257,1,I can only imagine how stressful this is.
257,2,"I know, it’s so hard."
257,3,I understand.
257,4,"I know, it's so hard to look at, isn't it?"
257,5,I am terrified.
257,6,I understand.
258,0,"Hey, it's good to see you too."
258,1,"Okay, I'm listening."
258,2,I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
258,3,I can see you're trying to put on a brave face.
258,4,"It sounds like you're trying to downplay things, but I sense some hurt."
258,5,You sound really hurt.
258,6,It sounds like you're really trying to protect yourself right now.
259,0,"Oh, that must have been so difficult."
259,1,I understand that must have been really upsetting.
259,2,"I'm so sorry, I know that's upsetting."
259,3,"Oh, no, I understand how upsetting that must be."
260,0,I just feel so lost right now.
260,1,"Oh, honey, that's so disappointing."
260,2,"I know, it's awful to have someone let you down like that."
260,3,"Oh, honey, that’s so disappointing."
260,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly frustrating and hurtful."
260,5,That must feel incredibly frustrating and hurtful.
260,6,It really does.
260,7,"Okay, okay, I get it."
260,8,"To the coffee shop, I need caffeine and some air."
260,9,"Okay, I get it, you're frustrated."
260,10,"I know, I know, but I need to know."
260,11,"Woah, okay, I get it, you're really fired up right now."
261,0,It's such a relief to hear that.
261,1,I'm so glad we finally agree on something!
261,2,"Oh, this is going to be good!"
261,3,"I know, right?"
261,4,I understand; it's okay to feel that way.
261,5,I'm sorry.
261,6,"Yeah, I could eat."
261,7,"Okay, let's go then."
261,8,"I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to."
262,0,I'm here for you.
262,1,"You're right, it's a quick sting but then it's over."
262,2,"I know it's scary, but you'll get through it."
262,3,"Oh, wow."
262,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds really hard."
263,0,"Really? I hadn't noticed, but now I'm feeling a little self-conscious."
263,1,"I know, right? It's such a confidence boost!"
263,2,"I'm so nervous, but maybe I will."
263,3,"Oh, right."
263,4,"I know it's tempting, but it's not worth it."
263,5,"Oh, wow, that's a really tough situation."
263,6,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry, I didn't realize."
263,7,I can see why you’d feel that way.
263,8,I'm glad you enjoyed that!
264,0,Hey.
264,1,Hey.
264,2,What's wrong?
264,3,You seem a little surprised.
264,4,You seem a little frustrated.
264,5,I'm just feeling a bit down.
264,6,That sounds really frustrating.
264,7,I’m sure that’s frustrating.
264,8,I understand.
264,9,"This is a tough one, huh?"
264,10,I can tell you're really stressed about this.
264,11,That's… a lot of pressure.
264,12,"That's really sweet of you, Chandler."
264,13,"That's so sweet, Chandler."
264,14,"That's a bit of a buzzkill, isn't it?"
264,15,"That's… actually really sweet, Chandler."
264,16,It must be frustrating to feel like you're running out of ideas.
264,17,"Because it’s not from the heart, right?"
264,18,"Oh, man, that's rough."
265,0,That must feel incredibly disappointing.
265,1,I'm so disappointed for you.
265,2,"I'm so sorry, that really stinks."
265,3,"I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
265,4,"I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that right now."
266,0,"Oh no, what is it?"
267,0,That sounds like it might be a little disappointing.
268,0,"Oh, are you feeling small right now?"
268,1,"Oh, I can understand how confusing that must be."
269,0,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
269,1,"No, no, don't be nervous; you don't have to sing."
270,0,I'm right here.
270,1,I'm so glad you're here.
270,2,"Yeah, he's right here."
270,3,Who is it?
271,0,I'm really sorry you feel that way.
271,1,I can see why you'd feel that way.
271,2,It sounds like you're feeling a little left out.
271,3,I am just being honest.
271,4,I'm just happy to hear that.
271,5,"Oh no, are you okay?"
271,6,That must have hurt!
271,7,What do you want me to do?
271,8,I'm really hurt right now.
271,9,I...I don't know what to do.
271,10,I feel so hurt right now.
272,0,I understand why you'd be so worried.
272,1,I'm just worried about your safety.
272,2,I can see why you'd be worried.
272,3,I'm just worried about you.
272,4,I'm feeling pretty shaken up right now.
272,5,"I’m sorry, I’m really not in the mood for games right now."
272,6,I love that game!
272,7,"Okay, I'll start us off."
272,8,I understand you're trying to get some rest.
273,0,"Oh, wow, that's a big step, Chandler!"
273,1,"Oh, honey, I know this is tough."
273,2,"I understand, it's a big decision."
273,3,"Oh, honey, I can hear the panic in your voice."
273,4,Ouch!
273,5,"No, just you."
273,6,I understand why you'd want to keep it a secret.
273,7,I can keep a secret.
273,8,"Oh, wow, you’re really feeling the pressure of this."
273,9,"I know this is a big deal, and you're probably feeling a lot right now."
273,10,"It’s a lot to keep to yourself, isn’t it?"
273,11,"I'm here for you, whatever you need."
273,12,"It's a big deal, huh?"
273,13,"Yeah, sure."
273,14,"Okay, let's go."
273,15,I'm glad we can hang out.
273,16,"Oh, you two, you’re so secretive!"
273,17,I'm sorry you feel that way.
273,18,"Oh, you poor thing."
274,0,"Oh, no, that's terrible!"
274,1,"I know, it's unbelievable."
274,2,"Oh, no, that's terrible!"
274,3,"I know, that's awful."
274,4,"Oh, honey, that's terrible!"
274,5,I can't believe this is happening.
274,6,"I'm so sorry, I can imagine how awful this must feel."
274,7,"I know, this is a nightmare."
274,8,I can only imagine how stressed you must be right now.
274,9,"I know, this is a nightmare."
274,10,I can only imagine how awful you must feel right now.
274,11,"No, I did not!"
274,12,"Oh, man, this is a disaster."
275,0,I understand your frustration.
275,1,I understand why you're so frustrated right now.
275,2,"Sure, what's up?"
275,3,I'm here for you.
275,4,"Oh, man, that sounds rough."
275,5,"Oh honey, what's wrong?"
275,6,I can only imagine how overwhelming that must feel right now.
275,7,You sound really stressed.
275,8,I'm so stressed right now.
275,9,I promise.
275,10,"I know, it's a lot to handle."
275,11,I'm not sure I do.
275,12,"I understand, it's tough to carry that burden."
275,13,I just... I can't right now.
275,14,"I'm just trying to talk to someone, alright?"
275,15,"I am so sorry, I can't keep this one to myself either."
275,16,"I know you're overwhelmed, but please just hear me out."
276,0,That must be so exciting!
276,2,I'm so excited!
276,3,I'm just trying to figure things out.
277,0,"That makes sense, it can be overwhelming with all the different advice out there."
277,1,That sounds like a good plan.
277,2,That must have been so disappointing.
277,3,That must have been incredibly frustrating.
277,4,That sounds really frustrating.
277,5,"I was just so angry, I didn’t care who knew."
277,6,"You felt like you were being unfairly treated, then."
278,0,"Oh, wow."
278,1,"Yeah, they're pretty awesome."
278,2,I'm glad you're feeling good about it.
278,3,I understand that would be a concern.
278,4,I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
278,5,Yay indeed!
278,6,That sounds so fun!
278,7,That must feel really good!
278,8,I'm so glad you're having fun!
279,0,"Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing."
279,1,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
279,2,Please don't; I just want to forget it happened.
279,3,"Okay, if that's what you want."
279,4,"I know it's hard, but please don't do anything you'll regret."
279,5,I'm really sorry you're hurting so much right now.
279,6,"I know, it's just that it's hard to deal with these things sometimes."
279,7,That sounds really frustrating.
279,8,Because I keep hoping I'll actually go someday.
279,9,"Wow, sounds like you're really frustrated."
279,10,"Oh, boy, that sounds rough."
279,11,She sounds pretty amazing.
279,12,I just don't want to be embarrassed again.
279,13,"You're really determined to do this on your own, huh?"
279,14,"It's still really hard, isn't it?"
279,15,"It’s just that you don’t really want to go, do you?"
280,0,"I'm feeling really anxious about it, though."
280,1,I understand it feels good to move on.
280,2,It's okay to feel that way.
281,0,Hey!
281,1,I'm so glad to hear from you!
281,2,"Oh wow, that sounds really uncomfortable."
281,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds really uncomfortable."
281,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been a surprise."
281,5,"Oh, honey."
281,6,"Oh honey, that's got to be a lot to process."
281,7,"Oh, wow, you must have been so surprised!"
281,8,I can see how that would feel strange.
281,9,"Oh, wow."
281,10,"Oh, wow!"
282,0,That sounds really convenient!
282,1,"Oh, I guess you wouldn't."
282,2,"Oh wow, that's a really interesting perspective."
283,0,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
283,1,"Whoa, hey, I didn't mean to offend you."
283,2,"You're really upset, aren't you?"
283,3,"You're really defending him, aren't you?"
283,4,I guess I’m just not as secure as I thought.
283,5,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings."
283,6,I just don’t understand why you have to be so negative about it.
284,0,That sounds like a difficult burden to carry.
284,1,"It's a heavy burden, isn't it?"
284,2,"I'm not sure I follow, either."
285,0,"Yeah, of course, come on in."
285,1,I'm so glad you do.
285,2,"Oh Joey, what is it?"
285,3,"Oh no, what is it?"
285,4,"Oh Joey, I don’t know."
285,5,"Oh, honey, that must be so frustrating."
285,6,"Oh, I can only imagine how frustrating that must be."
285,7,"I know it's frustrating, but we'll figure this out together."
285,8,"I know it’s frustrating, but we’ll figure this out."
285,9,"You're feeling overwhelmed right now, aren't you?"
285,10,I just... I feel like I'm failing her.
285,11,I understand this must be really frustrating.
285,13,"Oh honey, no, that’s not it at all."
285,14,"I know, it's tough to see."
285,15,"It’s so hard to see her like that, isn’t it?"
285,16,"It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's wrong, isn't it?"
286,0,I can understand why you'd be concerned about that.
286,1,I'm feeling really self-conscious now.
286,2,"I'm on my way to a very important meeting, but I'll be back soon."
286,3,"Oh, that sounds like it could be really helpful."
287,0,"I understand, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
287,1,I'm a little nervous now.
287,2,I wouldn't dream of it.
287,3,"Oh, wow, that's a lot of pressure."
287,4,I get that it feels like a lot of pressure.
287,5,"Yeah, it's tough when you feel like you're just a means to an end."
287,6,It sounds like you're worried about hurting her feelings.
287,7,I get that you're feeling conflicted.
287,8,I can see why you'd feel that way.
287,9,"I know, and I'm really nervous."
287,10,I know this is tough.
287,11,I'm actually really happy for you.
287,12,I'm so nervous for tonight.
288,0,"""Thank you so much!"""
288,1,"Oh, I see."
288,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
288,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds exhausting."
288,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds exhausting."
288,5,"Oh, come on, you must be exhausted."
288,6,I understand your frustration.
288,7,"Oh, wow, that's gotta sting."
288,8,"Oh, that's a shame."
288,9,"I'm so sorry, that must be awkward."
288,10,"Oh, wow."
288,11,"Oh, I see..."
288,12,I can understand why you'd be surprised.
288,13,I can see why that's a bit of a shock.
288,14,I can't believe it.
288,15,That's…interesting.
288,16,I can see why you'd be a little hurt.
288,17,I'm really happy you think so.
288,18,That's very kind of you to say.
288,19,That's very kind of you.
288,20,That's really generous of you.
289,1,"I'm here, I'm listening."
289,2,Thank you.
289,3,I just feel like I can’t keep going anymore.
289,4,That sounds incredibly isolating and frustrating.
289,5,It sounds like you feel really unseen and unappreciated.
290,0,"It's alright, take your time."
291,0,It sounds like you're really worried about that.
291,1,"Yeah, I know it doesn't always feel that way."
292,0,That sounds isolating.
292,1,That sounds incredibly isolating and painful.
292,2,That sounds incredibly isolating and painful.
292,3,I'm so sorry you're feeling this way.
292,4,I can't imagine how alone you must feel right now.
292,5,I can hear the desperation in your voice.
293,0,That must feel incredibly frustrating.
293,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
293,2,I can imagine how stressed you must be right now.
293,3,"Thanks, I appreciate that."
293,4,"I understand, it's a lot to take in right now."
293,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
293,6,I’m glad you think so!
293,7,"I hear you, it's a lot to deal with."
293,8,"Oh, Joey, you always know what to say."
293,9,I think you're both pretty great.
293,10,"Oh, honey."
293,11,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings."
293,12,"Oh, honey, that stings."
294,0,I'm just really frustrated right now.
294,1,That startled me.
295,0,I just feel so lost right now.
295,1,"Oh, wow."
295,2,"I know, right?"
295,3,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
295,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad."
295,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would upset you so much."
295,6,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings."
295,7,"Oh, Joey, I'm sorry you're feeling guilty."
295,8,"I know, I know, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel that way."
295,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would hurt you."
295,10,"I know, it just feels like you're choosing someone else over me."
295,11,"Oh, Joey, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize she was special."
295,12,"I know, it's tough when you feel like someone isn't understanding."
295,13,"Oh, Joey, that must have been a bit disappointing."
295,14,I just want to be happy for you.
295,15,I feel terrible for making you feel that way.
295,16,"Oh, I understand why you're excited."
295,17,"You go, girl!"
295,18,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you."
295,19,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
295,20,I just feel so… left out.
295,21,I just… I really wanted to go to that restaurant.
296,0,"Oh wow, that sounds incredibly stressful."
296,1,"Oh, that sounds stressful."
296,2,"Oh, hey Susan."
296,3,"I know, it's been a while."
296,4,"Oh, Ross."
296,5,You okay?
296,6,"Oh, right."
296,7,He's a she.
296,8,Right.
296,9,"Yes, she is."
296,10,That's a relief.
296,11,You seem a bit on edge.
296,12,You're welcome.
296,13,Are you okay?
296,14,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
296,15,"I know, it's a lot."
296,16,"Oh, this is just great."
296,17,"Yeah, I'm sure."
296,18,"Okay, but you're sure?"
296,19,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
296,20,"I'm... overwhelmed, to be honest."
297,0,That must be a relief to know.
297,1,You're very welcome; I'm glad I could help.
297,2,I understand this is frustrating.
297,3,"I'm so sorry, this must be difficult."
297,4,"Oh, Phoebe, I'm so glad you're here."
297,5,"Okay, I'll wait."
297,6,I understand you're feeling really urgent right now.
297,7,Yes.
297,8,"Okay, I'm coming."
297,9,I'm coming in.
298,0,I understand this is hard.
298,1,I can't.
298,2,"I know, it's frustrating when it feels like that."
298,3,It's frustrating when you feel like you're the only one who cares.
298,4,"I’m sorry, I really thought we were going to get to play longer."
298,5,I don't want to be cold either.
298,6,I can’t.
299,0,What's on your mind?
299,1,I just feel so lost right now.
299,2,"Oh, you're feeling confident!"
299,3,I'm not sure that's a good idea.
300,0,It sounds like you're really in a tough spot right now.
300,1,"Yeah, you can say that."
300,2,"It's rough being a Knicks fan sometimes, isn't it?"
300,3,Tell me about it.
300,4,"Yeah, I get it."
300,5,I hear your frustration.
300,6,"I'm a Celtics fan, so..."
300,7,"Oh, you poor thing."
300,8,It sounds like you're pretty passionate about your team.
300,9,"I hear you, it's tough."
300,10,"I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated right now."
300,11,I understand.
300,12,"It's okay, it's just a game."
300,14,"I'm so sorry, I can imagine how stressful this must be."
300,15,You seem a little nervous.
301,0,I can see how much you want things to be different.
301,1,"Oh, dear God, is he alright?"
301,2,I'll get right on it.
301,3,"I know, it's awful."
301,4,I understand this is difficult.
301,6,I'm right here.
301,7,"I'm here, I promise."
301,8,"I understand, it's difficult."
301,9,It sounds like you're really worried about him.
301,10,"This feels really hard, doesn't it?"
301,11,"That's a big decision, and it sounds like you're feeling conflicted."
301,12,"I know, it's tough."
301,13,I can't believe you're willing to put up with all of this.
301,14,I can't believe you still feel that way.
301,15,"Oh, Mindy..."
301,16,I just...I don't know what to say.
302,0,I can't believe you're putting this on us.
302,1,I know this is tough.
302,2,I can imagine that's really unsettling.
302,3,"I know, it's really awkward."
302,4,I understand that it's a difficult situation.
302,5,"I know, it's a really awkward situation."
302,6,"I know, it's just... awkward."
302,7,That sounds like a good way to take your mind off things.
302,8,"I get that, sometimes it's hard to find the motivation."
302,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that."
302,10,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take on."
303,0,"I understand, it's frustrating when you're pressed for time."
303,1,I can't believe this is happening right now.
304,0,I can see how that would feel disappointing.
304,1,I'm sure that's frustrating.
304,2,"I don't know, I just feel so lost."
304,3,It sounds like you're feeling pretty down about this.
304,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit helpless right now.
304,5,I'm just worried about you.
304,6,That sounds stressful.
304,7,Sounds like things are a bit chaotic right now.
304,8,You seem really frustrated right now.
304,9,That must be frustrating.
304,10,I guess you feel like you're being treated unfairly.
305,0,I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.
305,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel rushed."
305,2,I understand this must be frustrating.
305,3,"Oh, I completely understand."
305,4,That must be frustrating to deal with.
305,5,"I'm so sorry, that must have been really uncomfortable."
305,6,"I'm sorry, that must have felt really dismissive."
305,7,"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
305,8,It sounds like you're not really interested in what we have to say.
305,9,"I'm sorry, that sounds like a lot."
305,10,I can see why that might make you feel uncomfortable.
305,11,Sounds like a fun night out.
305,12,That sounds like fun.
305,13,"Yeah, see ya."
305,14,I'm glad.
306,0,It sounds like you really enjoy celebrating those special moments.
306,1,It sounds like you're really happy about the idea of forever.
306,2,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
306,3,"Yeah, it really sucks."
306,4,"Yeah, I'm definitely free."
306,5,"Great, I’ll call to make a reservation."
306,6,"I'm glad, Ross."
306,7,It’s always tough when things start to change like that.
307,0,Because I see you hurting.
307,1,I understand wanting someone to experience something you long for.
307,2,"It's hard to hear that, isn't it?"
307,3,It sounds like you're really passionate about this.
307,4,"I'm sorry, that must have been a difficult time."
307,5,"Oh, wow, sour cream on everything."
307,6,"I don't know, maybe."
307,7,"I know, and now you're really stuck."
307,8,I just don't want to lose her.
307,9,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
307,10,I'm not sure I know either.
307,11,I'm so sorry.
307,12,I can see how that would be a lot to process.
308,0,That sounds incredibly stressful.
308,1,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
308,2,"I'm a little nervous, but I'm ready to try."
308,3,Sounds like you're ready to get started.
308,4,"Oh, okay, um... wow."
308,5,"Alright, let's hear what you've got."
309,0,"Oh no, she seems really upset."
309,1,I'm just trying to catch up with Kathy!
309,2,Are you okay?
309,3,Hey.
309,4,Okay.
310,0,"No, I don't. I got rid of them a long time ago."
310,1,I'm just feeling nostalgic and was wondering if you ever look back at them.
310,2,"I understand, it can be such a financial burden."
310,3,"Oh, wow, that’s really thoughtful of you."
310,4,"Oh honey, I know that feeling."
310,5,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly stressful."
310,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
311,0,"Okay, I'm glad to hear that."
311,1,I promise.
311,2,I'm so glad you're being careful!
311,3,"Oh wow, that sounds exciting!"
311,4,"Oh no, that's disappointing."
311,5,"Oh, that's exciting!"
311,6,"Oh, you're excited about it!"
311,7,You sound a little disappointed.
311,8,"I know, it's a bit rough right now."
311,9,That's a big change.
311,10,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
311,11,"It's okay, we can figure it out together."
311,12,It must be so frustrating when you're not sure.
312,0,"Oh my god, I am so incredibly sorry."
312,1,I know this is tough.
312,2,"I know, and I'm sorry."
312,3,"Because you were what, Rachel?"
312,4,I'm not sure.
312,5,Okay.
312,6,"I'm sorry, Ross."
312,7,I'm not sure I do.
312,8,"I don't know, Ross."
312,9,I'm just so confused right now.
312,10,This is so confusing.
312,11,I just... I don’t know either.
312,12,I understand.
312,13,I just feel so… safe.
312,14,I understand.
312,15,I... I feel safe.
312,16,I understand.
312,17,"Oh, come on!"
312,18,"I’m sorry, Ross, I just… I don’t know what to do."
312,19,I can’t believe you just said that.
312,20,"I just, I don’t know what to do."
312,21,"Oh, Rach, I'm so confused."
313,0,Just trying to figure things out.
313,1,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
313,2,"Oh no, are you okay?"
313,3,"Oh, no, that's so frustrating."
314,0,"It really is, isn't it?"
314,1,So happy together.
314,2,It really is a beautiful thing to witness.
314,3,"Not often enough, I guess."
314,4,"Me too, it's just wonderful."
314,5,It's just… beautiful.
314,7,"It's okay, I understand."
314,8,"It's okay to feel a little bit jealous, it's natural."
314,9,"Yeah, I get it."
314,10,"It's hard not to think about your own life sometimes, right?"
314,11,I think I might have.
314,12,Oh.
315,0,"Oh, yeah, the cilantro fiend!"
315,1,He just showed up at my door with a huge bouquet of it.
315,2,"Wow, that's a huge opportunity!"
315,3,I'm so excited for you!
315,4,"I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
315,5,"That sounds like a lot to juggle, Monica."
315,6,I'm so happy for you!
315,7,I'm so glad you're excited too!
315,8,"I know, it's hard when things change like that."
315,9,"Not really, no."
316,0,Hi there.
316,1,"Hey, what's up?"
316,2,I appreciate you reaching out.
316,3,I appreciate you reaching out.
316,4,I understand you feel bad.
316,5,I understand you're hurting right now.
316,6,"Oh, wow, that's a real letdown."
316,7,I understand you're upset.
316,8,I can’t believe you’re doing this right now.
317,0,"No, I'm still stuck in traffic, I'm so sorry!"
317,1,I just feel so worried.
317,2,"Oh no, what did the note say?"
317,3,"Oh, honey, that sounds really disappointing."
317,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, that really stinks."
317,5,"Oh, that's too bad, it sounds like you were looking forward to spending time with him."
317,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad."
317,7,"Oh, good, maybe he can explain this ""Big Daddy"" thing."
317,8,"Aw, Joey, you hurt Phoebe's feelings!"
317,9,"Oh, honey, I get it, you're hurt."
317,10,"That's a pretty crummy thing to do, Joey."
317,11,"I know, it stinks, doesn't it?"
317,12,"I can see why you're upset, it's disappointing when plans get canceled."
317,13,"I understand, it's disappointing when someone cancels on you."
317,14,"I'm so sorry, Phoebe; that must feel really awful."
317,15,"I’m really hurt, Joey."
318,0,I had no idea.
318,1,I can't believe you didn't know.
318,2,Just a few minutes.
318,3,"Oh, wow."
318,4,"Oh, honey."
319,0,Sounds like you're setting a mood.
319,1,"It's the little things, isn't it?"
319,2,I'm listening.
319,3,"Okay, well, here goes."
319,4,It sounds like you're feeling a little overwhelmed.
319,5,And I feel…lost.
319,6,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
319,7,I can only imagine how incredible that must feel.
319,8,I'm all ears.
319,9,I'm nervous for you.
319,10,That sounds like a big decision.
319,11,I want to hear more.
319,12,That's a big goal.
319,13,I can see how that might come as a surprise.
319,14,"Oh, honey."
319,15,"This is a joke, right?"
319,16,This is… a lot.
319,17,"You’re serious, aren’t you?"
319,18,"Oh, honey."
319,19,Oh honey.
319,20,"Oh, honey."
319,21,I... I don't know what to think.
319,22,"Oh, honey."
320,0,"Yes, please."
320,1,"Oh no, is he okay?"
320,2,Who?
320,3,"The guy from the lab, he's having a total meltdown."
320,4,Oh my god.
320,5,"I don't know, I just... I really didn't want to die."
320,6,"Oh, honey."
320,7,"Yes, really."
320,8,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
320,9,"I know, it must be confusing."
320,10,I can see how that would be frustrating.
320,11,I understand.
320,12,I can see how much that meant to you.
320,13,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
320,14,I'm so sorry.
320,15,"Oh, honey."
320,16,You were one of the two.
320,17,"Oh, Chandler."
321,0,Hey there! How are you doing?
321,1,I missed you.
321,2,"Of course, I'm here for you."
321,3,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
321,4,I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now.
321,5,"Oh, wow."
321,6,It was a lot.
321,7,"Oh, wow."
321,8,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry."
321,9,"Oh, wow, that must be confusing."
321,10,"Oh, honey."
321,11,I am so sorry you're feeling this way.
322,0,I understand this must be incredibly upsetting for you.
322,1,"I can imagine that would be a confusing situation, to say the least."
323,0,It's understandable to feel that way.
324,0,"I know, and that makes this even harder."
324,1,I know this is a lot to take in.
324,2,That must have stung.
324,3,"Oh, honey."
324,4,It sounds like you’re feeling a bit lost and confused by it all.
324,5,"Oh honey, that sounds like a lot to take in all at once."
324,6,That sounds incredibly stressful and confusing.
324,7,I can't believe how confusing all of this is for you.
325,0,"Of course, what's on your mind?"
326,0,It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about that.
326,1,I'm sorry.
326,2,I'm so sorry.
326,3,I can hear the weight of that in your voice.
326,4,I can see you're feeling a bit uneasy.
326,5,I don't know if I can.
326,6,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
326,7,I don't know.
326,8,"Okay, I understand."
327,0,"I'm so sorry, that must have really hurt."
327,1,"It just hurts to hear, that's all."
327,2,"I'm sorry, that must have been a painful moment."
327,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
327,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
327,5,"I'm sorry, I do."
327,6,"I'm so sorry, Phoebe."
327,7,"That sounds really hurtful, Phoebe."
328,0,I understand.
328,1,"I understand, it must feel like you're constantly under attack."
328,2,I'm sorry you feel that way.
328,3,I'm sorry you feel that way.
328,4,That must feel really hurtful.
328,5,I’m sorry you feel that way.
328,6,I'm sorry to see you go.
328,7,"I'm going to miss you, you know."
328,8,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry."
329,0,"Oh wow, that's a huge life change!"
329,1,I know this is a lot to deal with right now.
329,2,I can't believe this is happening.
329,3,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
329,4,"Oh, honey, I can see you're really upset."
329,5,I just...I don't know what to say.
329,6,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed right now.
329,7,"I understand, it's frustrating when things feel out of your control."
329,8,I understand you're feeling really frustrated right now.
329,9,"It’s okay to be mad, I get it."
329,10,I'm so sorry you're feeling this way.
330,0,That's great to hear!
330,1,"Wow, that's great!"
330,2,I'm glad you like it.
330,3,I'm glad you like it!
331,0,"Oh, what's wrong?"
331,1,"Yeah, I think you're right, maybe a change of pace would be good."
331,2,"No, no, it's alright, I understand."
331,3,I understand.
331,4,I understand; it's hard when you feel left out.
331,5,I know it's frustrating when you feel like you're missing out.
331,6,I just feel so far away from everything.
331,7,"Oh, wow, that's exciting!"
331,8,I'm so glad you're feeling ready to move on.
331,9,I just want you to be happy.
332,0,"Oh, that must have been a bit jarring."
332,1,It's okay; it can be a lot to take in.
332,2,It’s okay.
332,3,I'm really sorry you're hurting.
332,4,"You're welcome, dear."
332,5,I'm just glad you're feeling a little better.
332,6,"It's alright, you're safe now."
332,7,I’m sorry to hear that.
332,8,It must be exhausting.
332,9,"Yeah, it is."
332,10,It's hard when you feel like you're the only one.
332,11,What's wrong?
332,12,"Oh honey, I am so sorry."
332,13,I'm so sorry.
332,14,"I know, it's exhausting to feel like you're the only one."
332,15,I can't believe you're saying that!
333,0,"Oh, okay, I understand."
333,1,"Yeah, he should be here any minute."
333,2,He's a paleontologist; I'm sure he'd appreciate the distinction.
333,3,"Oh, that must be a relief then."
333,4,It sounds like you're feeling a little out of place.
334,0,"Oh, that's awful, I'm so sorry."
334,1,"Oh, wow, that's awful."
334,2,"Of course, I understand."
334,3,I can understand why you'd want to do that.
334,4,"I'm sorry, man."
334,5,I can't believe I did that.
334,6,"I understand, it's a lot to process."
334,7,"Alright, take care of yourself."
334,8,Take care of yourself.
334,9,It sounds like you're really relieved.
334,10,"Oh, man, that sucks."
334,11,That must be so frustrating.
334,12,I can imagine how frustrating that must be.
335,0,"That sounds really exciting, Ross!"
335,1,I appreciate you saying that.
335,2,It sounds like you've come a long way.
335,3,"That sounds like a big step, are you ready for that?"
336,0,What's wrong?
336,1,"Oh, wow."
336,2,"Oh, man, I am so busted."
336,3,"Oh, man, that's rough."
336,4,"I know, I’m so sorry."
336,6,"Oh, man, that's gotta sting."
336,7,"I know, I know, it's a real bummer."
336,8,You seem really upset.
336,9,I understand how frustrating that must be.
336,10,"I know you're stressed, but let's try to focus."
336,11,I get that you're frustrated.
336,12,I'm not sure I should say.
336,13,"Wow, that's incredible!"
336,14,I can't believe it!
336,15,"Wow, that's incredible!"
336,16,"That's some impressive hustle, man."
336,17,"Wow, that's incredible!"
336,18,You must be so proud.
336,19,"You're really in the zone, aren't you?"
336,20,"It's gotta be the worst, right?"
336,21,"Oh, you poor thing."
337,0,Hello.
337,1,I don't know what else to do.
337,2,I guess it's hard to resist when it's already paid for.
337,3,It's just a little something to take home.
337,4,"Oh wow, you're really going for it, aren't you?"
337,5,"I don't know, but I hope you find them."
337,6,"Oh, no, you're serious about this, aren't you?"
337,7,I don't remember you telling me that.
337,8,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry, I thought I made that clear."
337,9,I don't remember that at all.
337,10,"Oh, so it's all a blur now?"
337,11,"Oh man, that sounds like it was a frustrating moment."
337,12,"You're feeling really frustrated right now, aren't you?"
337,13,"I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about."
337,14,"I know, I'm bummed too."
337,15,I understand.
337,16,I can see how stressed you are right now.
337,17,I know how important this is to you.
337,18,I know how much that stuff meant to you.
337,19,"I'm so sorry, I know how important those pictures are."
338,0,"Oh no, what's going on with them?"
338,1,...are really going to embarrass me.
338,2,"Oh no, that must be so frustrating."
338,3,I know it must be frustrating when things don't go as planned.
338,4,That sounds really frustrating.
338,5,I understand this must be difficult.
338,6,"Oh, wow, it sounds like you're in a really difficult spot right now."
338,7,"Oh, wow, so this isn’t how you wanted this to go."
338,8,"Oh, wow, that must be really stressful."
338,9,You seem really stressed about this.
338,10,I’m starving!
338,11,"Oh honey, I can see you're a bit flustered."
338,12,That sounds lovely.
338,13,Right?
338,14,That sounds fun!
338,15,Okay.
338,16,"Alright, alright, I can do that."
339,0,It sounds like you're feeling really guilty about that.
339,1,It sounds like you're feeling pretty bad about that.
339,3,"I understand, it sounds like you're feeling pretty down right now."
339,4,I can see you're frustrated.
340,0,Here you go.
341,0,"Okay, I see."
342,0,That sounds really unsettling.
342,1,"Oh, that must be unsettling."
342,2,"Oh, that sounds unsettling."
342,3,"Oh, that sounds genuinely frightening."
342,4,I can see why that would be unsettling.
342,5,You seem a little flustered.
342,6,I hear your frustration.
342,7,I just want to play a game that's fun for everyone.
342,8,I can see why you'd feel that way.
342,9,I just want this to be over.
342,10,"It does feel like a bit of a mess, doesn't it?"
342,11,I feel like you're really struggling with this.
342,12,It sounds like you're feeling pretty defeated right now.
342,13,"I’m just trying to have some fun, man."
342,14,"Okay, I can see you're feeling frustrated."
342,15,This is ridiculous!
342,16,"I know, that doesn't seem fair."
342,17,I can see why you'd be frustrated.
342,18,"I get it, it's frustrating when the rules don't seem fair."
342,19,I can't believe this is happening.
343,0,That sounds like a relief.
344,0,I'm sorry you feel that way.
344,1,I'm glad you're enjoying them.
344,2,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
344,3,I understand.
344,4,"Oh, did I hurt your feelings?"
344,6,"I don't know if I can, I'm kind of shy."
344,7,You got this!
344,8,"Good luck, have fun!"
344,9,I'm feeling the excitement building!
344,10,That's great!
344,11,That's fantastic!
344,12,This is so exciting!
344,13,This is so exciting!
344,14,"I know, it's exciting!"
344,15,"Oh, that must have been a letdown."
345,0,Hey there.
345,1,What's up?
345,2,I'm so glad you're feeling better.
345,3,"It's so freeing, isn't it?"
345,4,"Oh, you're having so much fun!"
346,0,I can understand why you'd feel a bit silly about it.
346,1,I'm still working on it!
346,2,"Oh no, you poor thing!"
346,3,"Oh, wow, that's a lot of pressure!"
346,4,"You're feeling a bit anxious about it all, aren't you?"
346,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was such a big deal."
346,6,"I know, it's frustrating when things feel unfair."
347,0,"Oh, no, that's a real bummer."
347,1,"Thanks, I really appreciate that."
347,2,"Yeah, of course!"
347,3,"Oh, that sounds like a rough situation."
347,4,"Wow, that must be a lot to take in."
347,5,"Oh, wow."
347,6,"I'm so sorry, that must be confusing."
347,7,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really painful."
347,8,It sounds like you're really hurting right now.
347,9,"I understand, it must be so hard."
347,10,"Oh, honey."
347,11,"I'm so sorry, Pheebs."
348,0,"Okay, I'm opening it."
348,1,I'm so excited for you!
348,2,"I'm so sorry, I know you were looking forward to that."
348,4,"Oh, I see, a small and intimate affair."
349,0,Hey there!
349,1,How are you doing?
349,2,Hi!
349,3,That sounds like fun!
349,4,That would be really fun!
349,5,That would be really nice.
349,6,"Well, that's great to hear!"
349,7,"Oh no, that's really frustrating."
349,8,I'm so sorry to hear that.
349,9,"Oh, Phoebe, that sounds frustrating."
349,10,"Oh, no!"
349,11,"I know it's hard, but we can work through this."
350,0,"It really is, isn't it?"
350,1,It really is.
350,2,I'm so glad you're enjoying it.
350,3,"Oh, wow, that's even better!"
350,4,"Oh wow, that sounds stressful."
350,5,"Oh, wow, that sounds stressful."
350,6,"It's okay, take your time."
350,7,Of course.
351,0,I know this is a lot to take in.
351,1,"I know, I know, it's a lot to take in."
351,2,"Oh, wow... Okay, I can see why you're upset."
351,3,I... I can't believe this is happening.
351,4,"Oh, man, that must be a lot to take in right now."
351,5,I can see this is really painful for you.
351,6,It sounds like you're really trying to express how you feel.
351,7,I know this must be a lot to take in.
351,8,"You're really digging yourself a hole, aren't you?"
351,9,I can see how much this must be hurting you.
351,10,You did?
351,11,"Whoa, hold on a minute, you did?"
351,12,I can't believe you would say that.
351,13,I can see why you're so upset right now.
351,14,"I'm sorry, did I go too far?"
351,15,I…I didn’t mean to offend.
352,0,I'm here for you.
352,1,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
352,2,I understand; it's frustrating when things aren't going well.
352,3,I can hear how much this is bothering you.
352,4,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
352,5,I'm all ears.
352,6,"I understand, it's frustrating when something important to you isn't taken seriously."
353,0,That sounds frustrating.
353,1,"No, I didn't."
354,0,That sounds like a lovely thought.
354,1,I just feel like I'm not being heard.
354,2,Have a good evening.
354,3,Goodbye.
354,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds frustrating."
354,5,"That's just... really frustrating, isn't it?"
354,6,It's tough when you miss someone.
354,7,You really loved her.
354,8,It sounds like you really miss Janice's energy.
354,9,It's frustrating when you feel unheard.
354,10,I can hear the excitement in your voice!
354,11,You sound so happy.
354,12,You seem really upset.
354,13,I'm so sorry.
354,14,"I know, it's so sad."
354,15,I'm so sorry.
354,16,"It's unsettling to think about, isn't it?"
354,17,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
355,0,It's alright.
355,1,"I don't know, but I can help you look for him."
355,2,That must be so hard.
355,3,I understand.
355,4,You must be relieved.
356,0,"Wow, that sounds exhausting!"
356,1,"I went to the farmer's market, it was the only way to get the good stuff."
356,2,"Wow, that sounds like a really long day already."
356,3,"Oh, honey, that must have been a long day."
356,4,"Wow, that must be a lot to take in."
356,5,Hey.
356,6,"Yeah, it sucks when things break."
356,7,That sounds really uncomfortable.
356,8,"Yeah, I'd be embarrassed too."
356,9,"Oh, man, that sucks."
356,10,"I know, it's frustrating when your friends aren't on your side."
356,11,"Oh, you're making jam for me?"
356,12,"Oh, that sounds delicious."
356,13,"I know, right? That's a real bummer."
356,14,"Oh, man, that's rough."
356,15,"Oh, Joe, that's a lot to take on all at once."
356,16,"I know, it's so hard to shake that feeling."
356,17,I know that feeling.
356,18,Woman.
356,19,Maybe you just need a good distraction.
356,20,"I know, it's tough."
356,21,"I'm so sorry, it is hot in here."
356,22,I'm gonna go cool off then.
357,1,It's understandable to be worried about that.
357,2,I guess I can see why he might be a little annoyed.
357,3,"I know, it's just... awkward."
358,0,"Oh, those look amazing!"
358,1,Coming right up!
358,2,"Oh, are you not feeling up to it?"
358,3,"Oh, that sounds painful."
358,4,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
358,5,I really hate going to the dentist.
358,6,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
358,7,It sounds like you're dealing with something really frustrating.
358,8,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly frustrating."
358,9,"Oh, that's awful; I can only imagine how scary that must be."
358,10,"Oh, that's gotta be hard."
358,11,"Oh, wow, that must have been a shock."
358,12,"Oh, honey, that must be so incredibly difficult."
358,13,"I'm so sorry, that must have been awful."
358,14,"Oh my gosh, that must be so incredibly upsetting."
358,15,"Wow, that's a lot of pressure to put on flossing!"
358,16,"I'm sorry, that sounds truly frightening."
358,17,It must be so frightening to believe that.
358,18,"I know, it's a lot to process."
359,0,Hi there.
359,1,"Hey, what's wrong?"
359,3,I understand.
359,4,I was just so embarrassed.
359,5,Oh.
359,6,"Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry."
360,0,I'm so sorry to hear that.
360,1,"I'm so sorry, I understand how much this hurts."
360,2,I understand.
360,3,That sounds like a difficult choice.
360,4,"It's a tough call, I know."
360,5,"It's really hard to know what to do, isn't it?"
361,0,That's a great start; you're getting there.
361,1,Three of the five assignments I have to finish tonight.
361,2,"Oh wow, that's quite a list!"
361,3,"It's a big decision, I bet."
361,4,I can imagine that must be a tough decision.
361,5,This is so stressful!
361,6,"Wow, that's a tough choice!"
361,7,"Yeah, and she's got that accent."
361,8,"Oh, wow, you're really going for it!"
361,9,You are not wrong.
361,10,"Oh, wow, you're really digging deep!"
361,11,It sounds like this is a really tough decision.
361,12,So you're torn between practicality and desire?
361,13,"It's a tough call, I get it."
361,14,"It's a tough decision, I get it."
362,0,I understand how much you want this.
362,1,What?
362,2,It's completely understandable that you're feeling impatient right now.
362,3,"It’s okay to feel disappointed, it’s a lot to process."
362,4,I just want this to be over.
362,5,"Oh, honey, you must be so uncomfortable right now."
362,6,"Okay, I'm ready."
362,7,"I know this is probably scary, but you're doing great."
362,8,I'm so scared.
362,9,"You're doing great, you've got this!"
363,0,"No, not yet, and I'm starting to get worried too."
363,1,Okay.
364,0,I understand.
365,0,Hello.
365,1,"I'm sorry, I seem to have misplaced it."
365,2,I understand; it's frustrating when you can't connect with someone.
365,3,I understand; it's frustrating when you can't see your friend.
365,4,I understand; it's frustrating to be separated like that.
365,5,"I understand, it's hard to see them go."
365,6,I understand this is frustrating.
365,7,I understand; it's really frustrating when you can't reach someone.
365,8,I just... I really need to tell him something important.
365,9,"It's alright, take your time."
365,10,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
365,11,"I'm sorry, I know this is frustrating."
365,12,"Oh, wow."
365,13,"It's alright, just take a breath."
365,14,I understand.
366,0,I'm listening.
366,1,I understand how that feels.
366,2,It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected.
366,3,I get it.
366,4,"Ouch, that sounds painful."
366,5,"No, I think I'm alright, just a little shaken up."
366,6,Take your time; I'll wait right here.
366,7,I can only imagine how awful you feel right now.
366,8,"I feel terrible, I really do."
366,9,I can't believe I did that.
366,10,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
366,11,I can tell you're really trying to be.
366,12,You're sure?
366,13,I can't believe I did that.
366,14,"I am so, so sorry."
366,15,I just focus on the good things.
366,16,I'm so jealous.
366,17,That's... actually a really good idea.
366,18,You think so?
367,0,I'm sorry.
367,1,Nothing.
367,2,I can imagine how frustrating that must be.
367,3,I can see why you'd feel that way.
367,4,I'm actually up a fair bit.
367,5,"That's a significant win, congratulations."
367,6,"Yeah, it's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
367,7,That's a lot!
367,8,"Whoa, that's a lot to risk!"
367,9,"You don't have to, you know."
367,10,That's a lot of pressure!
367,11,Yeah.
367,12,That's a lot to take in all at once.
367,13,"Okay, so it’s all about the draw now?"
367,14,That's a lot of money to be playing for!
367,15,"Oh no, what's happened?"
368,0,It sounds like you're trying to make me feel better.
368,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a truly wonderful surprise!"
369,0,I understand; it sounds really tough.
370,0,I just feel like I'm letting everyone down.
370,1,I understand you're feeling pressured.
370,2,I understand this must be overwhelming.
370,3,I understand this must be scary.
371,0,Hey.
371,1,What's up?
371,2,"Nowhere, just walking."
371,3,You okay?
371,4,Regular.
371,5,"Oh wow, that must be a lot to deal with."
371,6,"Yeah, I am."
371,7,That's a big step.
371,8,I'm excited for you.
371,9,That must be such a strange mix of emotions.
371,10,"Yeah, it's a big decision."
371,11,"It's just... a lot to take in, I guess."
372,0,I just feel so lost.
372,1,You seem upset.
372,2,I just don't want to talk about it.
372,3,"It's okay, you can tell me."
372,4,"Oh, honey, I understand."
372,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds really painful."
372,6,"Oh, honey, that sounds really painful."
372,7,That must be really hard to hear.
372,8,I'm so sorry.
372,9,It sounds like that's really painful.
372,10,A little what?
372,11,"I'm so sorry, that must be really hard to hear."
372,12,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
373,1,I understand.
373,3,I'm sorry.
373,4,"I appreciate that, but I'm really not hungry right now."
374,0,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
374,1,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
374,2,I’m just so frustrated right now.
374,3,"Wow, that's incredible!"
374,4,I understand how frustrating this must be.
374,5,I'm just so upset right now.
374,6,I understand this must be incredibly frustrating.
374,7,This is a nightmare.
374,8,I understand your frustration.
374,9,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
374,10,That's really kind of you to offer.
374,11,That's really kind of you to offer.
374,12,That's beautiful.
374,13,That's really sweet.
374,14,That's the most important thing.
374,15,It sounds like you're feeling really stressed about this.
375,0,That's wonderful!
375,1,Sounds good.
375,2,"It's alright, we all make mistakes."
375,3,"It's alright, accidents happen."
375,4,"It's alright, accidents happen."
376,0,Hey! What's up?
376,1,How are you doing today?
376,2,You seem really excited!
376,3,Ouch.
377,0,It sounds like that's been a difficult topic for you.
377,1,Right.
377,2,I can help you find it.
377,3,"That's a relief, I was worried I'd get lost."
377,4,"Oh no, that's a real bind!"
377,5,"I’m so sorry, that really, really sucks."
377,6,"Woah, okay, take a breath."
378,0,"Yeah, I'm here."
378,1,I'm so sorry to bother you.
378,2,"I'm just... feeling a little overwhelmed, I guess."
379,0,It sounds like you're really not feeling up to it.
379,1,It sounds like you're really struggling.
379,2,"I understand, it’s hard to face."
379,3,I understand.
379,4,"Oh, honey, I can hear the hurt in your voice."
379,5,"I understand, it feels like it's not really your choice."
379,6,"I understand, it's frustrating."
379,7,I hear your frustration.
379,8,I hear you.
379,9,"I'm not sure that's the best way to go about it, though."
379,10,I am.
380,0,I understand you're feeling really angry right now.
380,1,You sound really fired up about this.
380,2,"It’s okay, I understand."
380,3,I wish I could take it back.
380,4,"Yeah, I'm sure."
381,0,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
382,0,"Oh wow, you must be so proud!"
382,1,"Oh, come on, you're being too modest."
382,2,"It's nice to meet you, Dina!"
383,0,"Oh no, what's happening?"
383,1,"Oh, that sounds absolutely terrifying."
383,2,That sounds truly terrifying.
383,3,I understand your frustration.
383,4,"Oh no, what happened?"
383,5,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry you're feeling that way."
383,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious right now.
383,7,I can't imagine how frustrating that must be.
383,8,I'm so scared.
383,9,Okay.
383,10,I'm right here with you.
383,11,I'm right here.
384,0,Hi there!
384,1,"It's nice to finally meet you, Jim."
384,2,"It does feel like we're in each other's orbits, doesn't it?"
384,3,"Oh, are you asking me out?"
384,4,"Oh, is that excitement I hear?"
385,0,I can imagine that would be really hurtful.
385,1,"I'm sorry, are you okay?"
385,2,I just stubbed my toe.
385,3,"Oh, that sounds painful."
385,4,I'm sorry that happened.
385,5,"Oh, I do?"
386,0,What's wrong?
387,0,"It’s okay, it’s easy to get caught up in things."
387,1,I just feel so silly now.
387,2,"I'm so sorry, that must be a lot to process."
387,3,I'm not sure how I feel about that.
387,4,"Oh man, that must be a lot to process."
388,0,I'm not sure I understand.
388,1,"Oh wow, you're really excited about those tiles, aren't you?"
388,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds exciting!"
388,3,"Nothing, it's just… you seem a bit sensitive about it."
388,4,I guess I've just gotten used to it.
388,5,I just think you deserve something nicer.
388,6,It sounds like you're feeling a little defensive about your bathroom.
388,7,It sounds like you're really feeling overwhelmed right now.
388,8,I just don’t know if I can do this all again.
388,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
388,10,I’m so embarrassed right now.
388,11,"It’s okay, we’ll figure this out."
388,12,I just can’t believe it’s this bad.
388,13,"I know, it's overwhelming, isn't it?"
388,14,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make things worse."
388,15,"I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for this to happen."
388,16,"I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel this way."
389,0,Hi there.
389,1,How are you doing today?
389,2,Hello!
389,3,"Oh, no."
389,4,I'm so sorry.
389,5,"It's really hard, isn't it?"
389,6,That sounds so incredibly comforting.
389,7,Okay.
389,8,Sounds like you're going through a lot right now.
389,9,I'm here.
389,10,I can hear it in your voice.
389,11,"Oh, honey."
389,12,You sound really overwhelmed right now.
390,0,"I'm not sure, but I really hope so."
390,1,"Oh, wow, you seem pretty invested in this."
390,2,I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
391,0,Hi there. How are you feeling today?
392,0,Hey Joey! What's up?
392,1,"Hey, how are you doing?"
392,2,Hey!
392,3,What's up?
392,4,Ooh!
392,5,No way!
392,6,"Oh, Joey, that must have been disappointing."
392,7,"Aw, that's so sweet of you to ask."
392,8,...a rough day?
392,9,"Oh, I can understand that!"
392,10,"No, I’m not."
392,11,"That's good, Joey."
392,12,I miss you guys too.
393,0,I understand.
393,1,I'm here for you.
393,2,I understand.
393,3,I just don’t want him to feel like he’s out of his depth.
393,4,"Thanks, I'm going to need it."
393,5,"Oh, honey."
393,6,I can see you're really trying to encourage him.
393,7,"Oh, Joey, what's happened?"
394,0,I understand this must be incredibly upsetting.
394,1,That must have been so shocking and hurtful to hear.
395,0,"It really was, wasn't it?"
395,1,"Oh, really? What made this one not as good?"
395,2,It’s just hard to beat a good nap.
395,3,I knew you'd come around!
395,4,"It's nice to finally admit it, isn't it?"
395,5,"I know, it's hard to let go of a good nap."
395,6,"I know, I wish we could."
395,7,"I know, me too."
395,8,"I know, it's hard when something good ends."
396,0,I understand why that would bother you.
397,0,"No, thank you, but I appreciate you offering."
397,1,"We have water, soda, and juice."
397,2,That sounds... not so great.
398,0,"No, I'm really not."
398,1,I can get you some milk.
398,2,"Not really, no."
398,3,I'm sorry to hear that.
398,4,I can only imagine how that must feel.
398,5,I can only imagine how much that hurts.
398,6,"It's alright, it wasn't your fault."
398,7,"I don't know, but I just feel awful."
398,8,"You're right, it's not fair."
398,9,I just feel so awful that you had to experience that.
398,10,"I know, it's just awful."
398,11,"I know, it's awful, isn't it?"
398,12,"It's just awful, isn't it?"
398,13,"...a giant, slimy, oinking, pig!"
399,0,I understand your frustration.
400,0,That sounds like a relief.
400,1,"I'm so sorry, that must have been a shock."
400,2,It makes you feel like the only person in the world.
400,3,It's so hard when you're blinded by those things.
400,4,"It's okay to feel heartbroken, even when you knew it was the end."
400,5,"I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
400,6,"I just feel so foolish, and I hate that."
400,7,"It's a lot to take in, I'm sure."
400,8,I can understand that it feels worse now.
401,0,It sounds like it might be a little overwhelming.
401,1,"Oh, wow, that is a bit unexpected."
401,2,That must be frustrating.
401,3,"Oh, that must be so frustrating."
401,4,Okay.
401,5,"Yes, I am."
401,6,"I'm so sorry to bother you, I know you're busy."
401,7,"Oh wow, that's so sweet!"
401,8,"I am, yes."
401,9,"Oh, Lily, wow."
401,10,"It's really been a long time, hasn't it?"
401,11,"Oh, Lily, it’s so wonderful to hear your voice!"
401,12,"Oh, wow, that's... a lot to take in."
402,0,"I know, it's tough."
402,1,I really don't want to miss out on this with you.
403,0,"Oh, it sounds like you're feeling a bit nostalgic."
404,0,"That sounds like a nice idea, actually."
404,1,"Oh, honey, that's such a bummer."
404,2,"Oh, I am so sorry, I hate when that happens."
404,3,I don't know!
404,4,"Oh, Joey, that’s rough, man."
404,5,"I know things have been tough lately, and I'm here for you."
404,6,"Oh, Joey, that must feel really tough."
404,7,"I'm sorry, Joey, I just want to help."
404,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring that up."
404,9,"Yeah, she was."
404,10,"I know, man, it sucks."
404,11,"It’s still tough, huh?"
404,12,"I understand, it's tough when things get complicated."
404,13,Okay.
404,14,"Hey, man, whatever you need."
404,15,"Oh, that's too bad."
404,17,That sounds like a good idea.
404,18,No.
404,19,"It's tough when things get overwhelming, isn't it?"
405,0,I hear you; that sounds incredibly overwhelming.
405,1,I hear you.
405,2,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
405,3,I'm so sorry.
405,4,What's wrong?
405,5,That sounds terrifying.
405,6,"I'm so sorry, I can't imagine how difficult this must be."
406,0,"Hey Pheebs, welcome!"
406,1,Hi!
406,2,Hey!
406,3,"Hey, I'm glad you're here, too!"
407,0,I understand your frustration.
407,1,"Oh, I can understand how frustrating that must be."
407,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
407,3,"I know, it's just the worst."
407,4,"I'm sorry, that really sucks."
407,5,"Sure, I can take over for a bit."
407,6,"I understand, it's frustrating when things don't go your way."
407,7,I understand that you're frustrated.
407,8,"I understand, it's frustrating to feel stuck."
407,9,"I know, it's a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
407,10,"Oh man, right in the middle of it, huh?"
408,0,I understand.
408,1,I understand.
408,2,I hope you get some answers.
408,3,I hope so.
408,4,I really hope so.
409,0,Just some things that have been on my mind lately.
409,1,"Oh, honey, I know that feeling."
409,2,I hope he likes it.
409,3,"Hey, it sounds like you're feeling a little down."
409,4,Hi!
409,5,"Just the usual, you know, nothing special."
409,6,"That sounds really interesting, actually."
409,7,"I know, I'm sorry, we should have invited you."
409,8,I'm sorry you missed it.
409,9,You seem a little disappointed.
409,10,"I know, it's so frustrating to miss out on something like that."
410,0,"Oh, you're really not enjoying that, are you?"
410,1,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're feeling really insecure right now."
410,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your evening."
410,3,"Okay, I will."
410,4,"I'm sorry, I really am."
410,5,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
410,6,It sounds like you're really frustrated with me.
410,7,It sounds like you really care about his character.
410,8,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
410,9,I really am trying to.
410,10,I know you're hurting.
410,11,"I'm sorry, I know how much you care."
410,12,"It's just hard for us, too."
410,13,I miss us.
410,14,"Oh, Ross..."
410,15,I know.
410,16,I'm sorry.
410,17,I wouldn't know what to do.
410,18,"I know, I know."
411,0,That sounds like it might have been a difficult call.
411,1,"No, honey, it wasn't Jack."
411,2,"Oh, thank goodness."
411,3,"It's alright, I understand your relief."
411,4,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
412,0,I can hear how much pain you're in right now.
412,1,I can understand why you might be frustrated right now.
412,2,That sounds like a challenge!
412,3,"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
412,4,It certainly does.
412,5,I'm glad you like it.
412,6,It sounds like you're really proud of it.
412,7,I can't believe it.
412,8,"I know, it's hard to let go of something you love."
412,9,"I don't know, I guess I do."
412,10,It’s hard to let go of something you love.
412,11,"I know, it's a lot of money."
412,12,That’s a lot of money.
412,13,I can't believe we're even talking about this.
412,14,I know it's frustrating when things don't go as planned.
412,15,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
412,16,I'm a carpenter.
413,0,"Oh, that's so exciting!"
413,1,"Yes, I can."
413,2,It must be so frustrating to feel stuck.
413,3,I hope he's not scaring you.
413,4,"Oh no, here we go."
414,0,Hey there.
414,1,How are you doing?
414,2,Hey!
414,3,Just hanging out.
414,4,"That's a tough one, I'm not sure."
414,6,"Oh, that's so frustrating!"
414,7,You're very welcome!
414,8,We think you're pretty cute too!
414,9,It makes me happy to hear that.
414,10,"Okay, good night!"
414,11,Good night!
415,0,It sounds like something is bothering her.
415,1,It's frustrating when you don't understand.
415,2,It sounds like you really want to figure this out.
415,3,"Alright, I'm ready."
415,4,I'm really nervous.
415,5,"Okay, I'm ready."
415,6,Comedy.
415,7,That's a tough call.
415,8,"Oh, that's a tough one."
415,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
415,10,"It's alright, I understand."
416,0,"I know, it's so frustrating when things don't go as planned."
416,1,"It's hard to take it all in, isn't it?"
416,2,It sounds like you're feeling pretty disappointed.
416,4,I understand your frustration right now.
417,0,I understand.
418,0,"Okay, I'm ready."
418,1,"Oh, I see."
418,2,"Oh, I see."
418,3,I understand that must feel a bit confusing.
418,4,"Oh, I'm sorry, I seem to have made a mistake."
418,5,I understand this must feel a little strange.
418,6,"Okay, Clifford, I'll need your date of birth."
418,7,"October 22, 1968."
418,8,"Okay, Clifford, let's move on to some more personal questions."
418,9,Forty-five.
418,10,I understand that must be frustrating.
418,11,"Okay, I get it, this is all a bit frustrating."
418,12,I understand that might be frustrating.
418,13,"No, I am not."
418,14,I understand.
418,15,That must be frustrating to hear.
418,16,I understand this might feel a bit intrusive.
418,17,This is more than I bargained for.
418,18,I am so sorry to hear that.
418,19,"It's alright, it's been a while."
418,20,I can only imagine how difficult that must be.
418,21,That seems like an awfully insensitive question to ask.
418,22,I understand.
419,0,It sounds like you've been through a lot.
420,0,"Oh, that's so exciting!"
420,1,"Okay, here it goes..."
420,2,I'm so excited for you!
420,3,"Oh, honey, I can see how that would be frustrating."
420,4,"Oh, Pheebs, that sounds frustrating."
420,5,"Oh, Pheebs, I didn't realize you were feeling frustrated."
420,6,"Oh Pheebs, I get it, it's frustrating when things don't work out as planned."
420,7,"Oh, that's right."
421,0,Okay.
421,1,You sound determined.
421,2,That's a big step.
421,3,I'm really nervous for you.
421,4,You've got this.
421,5,You've got this.
421,6,You seem a little nervous.
421,7,"Okay, this is it."
421,8,I'm really nervous.
422,0,That sounds like a really valuable skill to have.
422,1,"Yeah, I can see how that might come across."
422,2,That sounds incredibly difficult.
422,3,"Wow, that must have been incredibly difficult."
422,4,You're feeling really conflicted.
422,5,I hope so.
422,6,"Yes, you are."
422,7,That sounds…difficult.
423,0,"That's good to hear, honey."
423,1,That's good to hear.
423,2,"Oh, honey, that sounds difficult."
423,3,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
423,4,I just don't know what to do.
423,5,I can't imagine how hard this must be.
423,6,I just want to see you.
423,7,"I know, it's just... a lot to process."
423,8,I just don't understand.
423,9,"Oh honey, I am so sorry."
423,10,I'm so happy for you!
424,0,That sounds exciting!
424,1,With Sarah. I'm so nervous!
424,2,"Oh, that's exciting!"
424,3,"Yeah, her."
424,4,That sounds really tough.
424,5,It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now.
424,6,That must be so confusing and difficult.
424,7,It sounds like you're really torn.
424,8,It sounds like you're really torn.
424,9,It sounds like you're really conflicted.
424,10,It sounds like you're really torn.
424,11,That sounds complicated.
424,12,"That would make it a tough choice, for sure."
424,14,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
424,15,"It was, uh, okay."
424,16,It sounds like you're really stressed out about this.
425,0,"Wow, that must be overwhelming."
425,1,That sounds incredibly painful.
425,2,That sounds incredibly painful.
425,3,That sounds absolutely devastating.
425,4,That sounds absolutely devastating.
425,5,"Oh, wow."
426,0,Hey there.
426,1,"It's okay, I understand."
426,2,"Oh, that's so thoughtful of you."
426,3,I appreciate that.
426,4,I understand that you want to help.
426,5,I understand.
426,6,I understand; it must be hard.
426,7,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
427,0,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
427,1,"I'm just trying to figure things out, too."
428,0,"Okay, I'm listening."
428,1,It sounds like you really care about her.
428,2,It's okay to feel that way.
428,3,"It's okay, it's alright to feel confused."
428,4,"I know, it's all a bit much right now."
428,5,"Oh, that must be so frustrating!"
428,6,"Oh, that's really not what you want to hear right now, is it?"
428,7,"I'm sorry, this must be so confusing."
428,8,That sounds really disappointing.
429,0,You look wonderful.
429,1,That hurts.
429,2,"I'm sorry, I'll try harder."
429,3,That sounds really frustrating.
429,4,I'm sorry you're feeling that way.
429,5,I'm afraid.
429,6,That must be nerve-wracking.
429,7,I understand; sometimes you just need a break.
429,8,"Sure, I can do that."
429,9,I know it's been a long time.
429,10,I can see that you're really upset.
429,11,I can't believe you're doing this to me.
430,0,"Of course, I understand."
430,1,I understand that feeling.
430,2,"I understand, and I'm here for you."
430,3,I can't believe you're here right now.
430,4,"Oh, you're really worried about this, aren't you?"
430,5,"It's okay, I understand you're feeling a little flustered."
430,6,"Oh, no, I’m so sorry!"
430,7,"I am so sorry, I didn’t mean to cause any trouble."
430,8,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
431,0,Hey! What's up?
431,1,"Hey, what's wrong?"
431,2,What's up?
431,3,"Yeah, I remember feeling pretty bummed about that."
431,4,I know how much you wanted to go.
431,5,"Oh my gosh, really?"
431,6,We were thinking of going to London!
431,7,Oh.
431,8,"Oh, wow, you sound so excited!"
431,9,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, Pheebs."
431,10,"I'm so sorry, Pheebs."
431,11,"I'm so sorry, Pheebs."
431,12,I can hear how disappointed you are.
431,13,I can see why you're disappointed.
431,14,I can hear the disappointment in your voice.
431,15,"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
431,16,I'm so sorry; I didn't realize how much this meant to you.
431,17,I can't believe you're saying that.
431,18,I can see how that would be frustrating.
431,19,I understand; it's disappointing when things don't go as you'd hoped.
432,0,"No, she's not."
433,0,It sounds really tough to watch.
433,1,"It really doesn't feel all right, does it?"
434,0,It sounds like you're feeling really burnt out.
434,1,I understand how overwhelming that can feel.
434,2,I understand; it's a lot to navigate.
434,3,It just feels like everything is changing.
434,4,That’s a really beautiful thought.
434,5,"That's a long time to wait, though."
434,6,That sounds incredible.
434,7,"It's a powerful feeling, isn't it?"
434,8,You're welcome.
434,9,"Sure, I could use a coffee."
434,10,Sounds like a plan.
434,11,"I’m sorry, I didn’t."
434,12,"Well, that sounds like a plan."
434,13,Good night.
434,14,Sleep well.
435,0,Hi there.
435,1,"Hey sweetie, how are you?"
435,2,It's wonderful to hear you say that!
435,3,I'm so glad you're having a good time!
435,4,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
435,5,"It's okay, I'm sure it's a bit confusing."
435,6,"Thank you, that means a lot."
435,7,It's lovely to see you both so happy.
435,8,Thank you!
435,9,"Oh, honey."
436,0,I can see why you'd feel that way.
436,1,It's infuriating when people act so entitled.
436,2,I hear your frustration.
436,3,"I know, it's so frustrating when people are inconsiderate."
436,4,That's incredibly frustrating.
436,5,I bet that’s frustrating.
437,0,Hey.
437,1,"Wow, that's incredible!"
437,2,"I know, right? It's terrifying!"
438,0,"Oh no, are you alright?"
438,1,It sounds like you're frustrated.
438,2,"Okay, okay, I get it."
438,3,What's wrong?
438,4,I can't believe you're doing this!
438,5,You seem really excited!
438,7,Are you okay?
438,8,I am so sorry.
438,9,I can tell you're really uncomfortable right now.
438,10,I'm sorry you missed it.
438,11,I’m sorry you didn’t get to see more.
438,12,I can see how that might be a little awkward.
438,13,That must have been a surprise.
438,14,I can tell you're trying to be cool about it.
438,15,"I'm trying, I really am."
439,0,I understand; it can be tough when you feel that way.
439,1,I understand.
439,2,"Okay, that makes sense."
439,3,I'm really excited for you!
439,4,You seem a little unsure.
439,5,I am!
439,6,"Oh, you're really looking forward to this!"
440,0,"Right, and that's proving to be a challenge, isn't it?"
440,1,"Oh, that's frustrating."
440,2,"Oh, wow."
440,3,"I understand, that's gotta feel frustrating."
440,4,I know this is frustrating; we were hoping for a quick fix.
440,5,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
440,6,This is... a lot.
440,7,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry."
440,8,"Oh, bless his heart."
440,9,I can see you're feeling a little frustrated.
440,10,"Oh, honey."
440,11,"I'm sorry, that is pretty gross."
440,12,"Oh, this is a lot."
440,13,I guess we're committed now.
441,0,"Oh, you're really feeling this, aren't you?"
441,1,"It's okay, accidents happen."
441,2,I feel terrible that I ruined it.
441,3,It's true; it must be uncomfortable.
441,4,I feel terrible that I ruined your shirt.
441,5,That's so thoughtful of you.
441,6,"Oh, thank you so much."
441,7,"It's alright, I can go change."
441,8,"Oh, well, in that case, thank you."
441,9,"It is, isn’t it?"
442,0,That's wonderful to hear!
442,1,I'm so glad you like it too!
442,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
442,3,I'm sure that's for the best.
442,4,I'm so sorry.
442,5,I can't believe we did this.
443,0,I'm excited to see what we can do!
443,1,Sounds like you need a little boost before we start.
443,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm good, thanks."
443,3,"Way closer, like practically next door."
443,4,"I'm so ready, let's do this!"
443,5,"I understand, you want your own."
443,6,I just need a minute to collect myself.
443,7,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of emotions right now.
444,0,I saw your car parked outside.
444,1,"No, it's not."
444,2,"Oh, that's too bad."
444,3,"It's okay, I'm just glad to have a car."
444,4,I can only imagine how difficult that must have been.
444,5,"Oh, man, that's rough."
444,6,It sounds like you're not feeling that great about it.
445,0,"That's okay, I understand."
445,1,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you were really scared."
445,2,"Oh, honey, you were just trying to protect yourself."
445,3,I'm here for you.
445,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been hard."
445,5,I'm here for you.
445,6,"Oh, that's great news!"
445,7,I think I may be able to book the venue for you.
445,8,"I'm so nervous, I can't help it."
445,9,"Oh, sweetheart, I am so sorry."
445,10,"I'm so sorry, honey."
445,11,"Oh honey, I am so sorry."
445,12,I'm just so disappointed.
445,13,"I know, honey, it's a lot to take in."
445,14,I know it feels like the world is ending right now.
445,15,"I know this is hard, but we'll get through it."
445,16,I just wanted you to be happy.
445,17,"I’m so sorry, honey."
445,18,"Oh, honey, I know how much this all means to you."
445,19,I can't believe this is happening.
445,20,"Oh, honey, that's just awful."
446,0,"Not quite, but I’m doing okay."
446,1,I can only imagine how you feel.
446,2,That sounds like a lot to process.
446,3,"That would be pretty cool, actually."
446,4,That's quite a legacy to imagine.
446,5,"That's a pretty great idea, actually."
446,6,"Oh right, you’re right."
446,7,"You’re right, I’m being a bit ridiculous."
446,8,"Yeah, see you later."
446,9,Bye.
446,10,I get that it's a lot to take in.
446,11,"Yeah, I'm in."
446,12,I'm really glad to hear that.
446,13,"Okay, okay, I'm going!"
446,14,I can feel your frustration.
446,15,I'm really sorry you feel that way.
446,16,That sounds really frustrating.
446,17,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
446,18,It sounds incredibly frustrating.
446,19,It's frustrating when you can't figure out why you're feeling this way.
447,0,"Okay, I understand."
447,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been so awkward."
447,2,"Oh, wow, that must have stung."
448,0,"Oh man, roller blades, those were the days."
448,1,What's that?
448,2,I remember you.
448,3,"Oh, honey."
448,4,That sounds really exhausting.
448,5,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed."
448,6,That must be so frustrating.
448,7,"I'm sorry, that must feel pretty isolating."
448,8,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration.
448,9,It's tough feeling like you're missing out on something.
448,10,That sounds really frustrating.
448,11,"I know, it's hard to leave."
449,0,Winterberry sounds lovely.
449,1,"Okay, I'm here."
449,2,"It's alright, really."
449,3,"It's okay, we all make mistakes."
449,4,"It's okay, you don't have to explain."
449,5,It was just a really bad day for me too.
449,6,"Yes, I do."
449,7,I…I do.
449,8,"Oh, Ross."
449,9,"I know, it hurts."
449,10,I know it hurts.
449,11,"I know, it hurts."
449,12,"Yes, I understand."
449,13,Okay.
450,0,I appreciate you looking out for me.
450,1,"Oh, I understand wanting to get rid of it completely."
450,2,That sounds really embarrassing.
450,3,"I can see why you'd want that, it's probably hard to deal with."
450,4,I can't believe you would do that.
450,5,"I'm sorry, I know you were looking for something else."
450,6,I can't believe you did this.
450,7,I just want you to be happy.
450,8,It's okay to explore those feelings.
450,9,"You’re feeling conflicted, aren’t you?"
450,10,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
450,11,"I can see that, it must feel like such a whirlwind."
450,12,"I just feel so confused, and I don’t know what to do."
450,13,I'm so happy for you!
450,14,"Oh honey, of course."
450,15,"No, but he’s kind of a big commitment right now."
450,16,"Oh, Pheebs."
450,17,"Oh, honey."
450,18,"Oh, wow."
450,19,I can see you're really excited.
450,20,You seem to be taking this really well.
450,21,"I don’t know, I don’t know what to do."
450,22,"Oh, honey."
450,23,"Yeah, I can see how that would make it hard."
451,0,That must be incredibly frustrating.
451,1,I can see how frustrating that must be.
451,2,I understand your frustration.
451,3,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating to be so close."
451,4,"I understand, it's frustrating when you've invested so much time."
451,5,I know how frustrating this must be.
451,6,I know you feel trapped right now.
451,7,"I know it's frustrating, but we can figure this out."
452,0,It sounds like you're really excited about it!
452,1,"Oh no, that sounds awful."
452,2,"Ugh, that's awful."
452,3,"Oh man, that's such a bummer."
452,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds rough."
453,0,"Oh my gosh, that must be shocking to see."
453,1,"Oh my gosh, that must be so shocking to see."
454,0,Sounds like a good plan.
454,1,I understand; it's not about the hormones.
454,2,"I'm sorry, that sounds like a really difficult situation."
455,0,I'm here.
455,1,I don't even know where to begin.
455,2,That sounds nice.
455,3,"I guess it's a little awkward, isn't it?"
455,4,"Yeah, I suppose I would."
455,5,"Oh, wow."
455,6,"Yeah, I know, it sounds silly."
455,7,I'm honestly surprised.
455,8,I'm so sorry; I can see how that would feel awful.
455,9,Oh.
455,10,I'm sorry.
455,11,I can see how that would be difficult.
455,12,"Yeah, I'd really like that."
455,13,I'm really glad to hear that.
455,14,"Okay, yeah, I'll see you."
455,15,"Bye, Rachel."
455,16,Bye.
455,17,Wow.
456,0,"Oh wow, that's exciting!"
456,1,"Oh, wow."
456,2,"I know, I'm so sorry."
456,3,"I know, I'm so sorry."
456,4,I can't believe this is happening.
456,5,"I know, it's just awful."
456,6,I can't believe this is happening.
456,7,"I know, I messed up, and I'm so, so sorry."
456,8,"You're really trying to make this right, aren't you?"
456,9,"Oh, Chandler, I can see how much this means to you."
456,10,"You're really disappointed, aren't you?"
456,11,"I know you're disappointed, but don't give up hope."
457,0,I'm not ready to talk about that right now.
457,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds really difficult."
457,2,I understand.
457,3,"Okay, I'll be right there."
457,4,That sounds like a really nice idea.
457,5,"I know, it's a lot to process."
457,6,I know things feel really complicated right now.
457,7,"Oh, Barry, I'm so sorry."
457,8,It must have been incredibly difficult.
457,9,"I'm so sorry, Barry."
457,10,"I'm so sorry, Barry."
457,11,I’m so glad.
457,12,"I know, it's amazing, right?"
457,13,I am so sorry.
458,0,What's wrong?
459,0,That sounds incredibly difficult to go through.
459,1,"I understand, that's a lot to take in."
459,2,"You really got me, didn't you?"
459,3,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
459,4,"Oh, you're nervous, aren't you?"
459,5,I understand that you're nervous.
459,6,I understand this is a little nerve-wracking.
459,7,"Okay, I will."
459,8,"Deep breaths, it's okay."
459,9,"Alright, I'm ready."
459,10,"It's okay, it's just a little puff."
459,11,I'm really not looking forward to this.
460,0,I understand; that's a difficult feeling to have.
460,1,"Okay, I understand."
460,2,"I understand, it's frightening to think about."
460,3,"That sounds really scary, I get why you'd feel that way."
461,0,"Hi Robert, it's nice to meet you."
461,1,"Hey Robert, good to meet you."
461,2,"Hey, Robert."
461,3,"Oh, wow."
462,0,Hey there.
462,1,How are you doing?
462,3,"Yeah, I think I know what you mean."
462,5,"Oh, wow, that sounds exciting!"
462,6,I am!
462,7,"That sounds ambitious, but exciting!"
462,8,It can be really frustrating when things don't go as planned.
462,9,"Oh, wow, I can see that."
462,10,"Oh, no, that's gotta be frustrating."
463,0,Hi there! How are you feeling today?
463,1,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
463,2,I'm just so frustrated with this whole situation.
463,3,That must be really hard.
463,4,I just feel so bad about it.
463,5,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
463,6,I know it's hard when you're craving something and can't have it.
463,7,You sound really disappointed.
463,8,"You really miss it, don't you?"
463,9,I can see how that would be tempting.
463,10,"I know, it's frustrating when you're really looking forward to something."
463,11,"You're right, it's hard to resist."
463,12,I just want to eat that cheesecake!
463,13,"Oh, that sounds like a great idea!"
464,0,"Okay, I'm listening."
464,1,Is something the matter?
464,2,I'm excited to see what you chose!

464,13,That's so sweet.
464,14,I'm glad you think so.
464,15,I can see how that might have felt.
464,16,"You're doing great, really."
464,17,"Oh, honey."
464,18,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
464,19,"Oh, honey, I get it."
464,20,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
465,0,"Not much, just feeling really down today, I guess."
465,1,"Whoa, that sounds like a lot of anger."
465,2,I just... I don't know how to fix this.
465,3,"Oh, man, that must have been a really embarrassing moment."
465,4,"I know, I know... I messed up."
465,5,"You sound a little lost, honey."
466,0,"Wow, that must feel pretty isolating for him."
466,1,"Yeah, it's kind of a big deal these days."
466,2,"Yeah, I think it's really special."
466,3,I'm really sorry to hear you feel that way.
466,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend."

466,7,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
466,8,I can see you're really upset about this.
466,9,"It's okay, you can have it back."
466,10,"I understand, it's frustrating when something important to you is taken."
466,11,I can see you're really upset about this.
466,12,This is so frustrating.
466,13,I can see this is really upsetting for you.
466,14,I understand that you're really upset.
466,15,I can see you're really upset about this.
467,0,Good luck!
467,1,I'm about to ask my boss for a raise.
467,2,Good luck! I hope it goes well.
468,0,I hope everything goes well for you.
468,1,"I'm so sorry, I didn't think this through."
468,2,"Oh honey, that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen."
468,3,"Oh, I hope I didn’t offend you."
468,4,"Oh, I wouldn't have missed it for the world!"
468,5,"Oh, honey, don't worry about it, it's fine."
468,6,I can only imagine how difficult this must be.
468,7,I can see that.
468,8,I understand it's a difficult situation.
468,9,I can see how that would be difficult.
469,0,It sounds like you're trying to be strong.
469,1,"Oh my goodness, that must have been incredibly intense."
470,0,"No, I haven't."
471,0,"Oh, that's really disappointing."
471,1,I understand.
471,2,I'm really not comfortable with that.
471,3,"No, not at all."
471,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
471,5,What's wrong?
471,6,I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
472,1,"It's alright, things happen."
472,2,I understand how devastating that must feel.
473,0,I'm so frustrated right now.
473,1,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
473,2,I'm just so frustrated right now.
473,3,"You're right, it's just so frustrating."
473,4,"I know, it's just frustrating when she's not settling."
474,0,"Oh, Mon, you sound a little stressed."
474,1,"It's okay, what's wrong?"
474,2,For not being there for you lately.
474,3,"Oh, honey."
474,4,"We feel terrible, Monica."
474,5,"I know, I can't believe we did that."
474,6,"Oh Monica, I'm so incredibly sorry you missed out."
474,7,I can only imagine how disappointed you must feel.
474,8,"I know you're disappointed, Monica."
474,9,"I know, I'm so disappointed, too."
474,10,What do you mean?
474,11,I was really looking forward to it.
474,12,"Yeah, I can see that."
474,13,"I just mean, maybe we could still salvage something?"
474,14,"Oh, Monica."
474,15,"You guys, you really are the best friends a girl could ask for."
474,16,"Oh, Monica, you're really trying to make the best of this, aren't you?"
474,17,I'm so glad we could salvage something good from this.
474,18,"Oh, honey."
475,0,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating when you're hoping for sunshine."
475,1,You sound really frustrated right now.
475,2,I'm sorry you're feeling so down.
475,3,I am so over this!
475,4,I'm open to suggestions; what sounds good to you?
475,5,That sounds fun!
475,6,Sounds like fun!
475,7,"Aww, what's wrong, sweetie?"
475,8,Because I'm just not feeling it today.
475,9,"Oh, so you're worried about a potential ping pong rage?"
475,10,"Oh, sweetie, I know you don't mean to be!"
475,11,"Oh, you think I'm that bad?"
475,12,"Oh, honey..."
475,13,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
475,14,I'm still here.
475,15,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
475,16,"Oh, honey..."
476,0,"It's okay, I'm just a little shaken up."
476,1,"Oh, that's good."
476,2,I can imagine that was a bit unsettling.
476,3,I didn't mean to make you jump.
476,4,"Oh my god, are you okay?"
476,5,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
476,6,I can't believe this is happening.
476,7,"Yes, everyone is safe."
476,8,"Oh, thank goodness."
476,9,"I know, I know... It's a lot to take in."
476,10,I can't imagine what you're going through right now.
476,11,"I know, it's awful, isn't it?"
477,0,"It's starting to feel like forever, isn't it?"
477,1,"Wow, that's intense."
477,2,"Wow, that's intense."
477,3,"I understand, it's a lot to take in."
477,4,"Oh, man, I’m sorry, that sounds tough."
477,5,That's wonderful to hear!
477,6,"Yeah, I can understand how that would be disappointing."
477,7,"Oh, wow, that must be such a relief!"
477,8,It's just that I really thought this would be different.
477,9,"Oh, wow, that's really wonderful!"
477,10,"I'm sorry, it's just that I'm really happy about this."
477,11,"It's right here, but you seem a little preoccupied."
477,12,"It's alright, I know you're not doing it on purpose."
477,13,"Oh man, I’m so excited!"
477,14,"Yeah, it's been a rough week, huh?"
477,15,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
477,16,That sounds absolutely awful.
477,17,"Oh, wow, that's a big step!"
477,18,"Oh no, how did it go?"
478,0,You seem really nervous right now.
478,1,"Oh, wow, you're really feeling the pressure, huh?"
478,2,Hey!
478,3,Hi! It's so good to see you both!
478,4,"Just hanging out, excited to see you!"
478,5,"Oh, fun!"
478,6,"Wow, that sounds like a lot to take in."
478,7,"Wow, that sounds intense."
478,8,"I get it, it's hard to see things you believe in questioned."
478,9,"I guess it's a pretty big question, isn't it?"
478,10,"Wow, it sounds like you're really excited about the idea."
478,11,You okay?
478,12,I can see this is making you feel a little uncomfortable.
478,13,"Oh wow, okay, well, good luck!"
479,0,That sounds exciting!
479,1,"Oh, that's cool, he was always a good guy."
479,2,"Oh, that's nice, you must be excited!"
479,3,"That's so cool, I always thought Joey was a great name."
479,4,That's a really cool opportunity.
479,5,"Wow, that must have been really surprising."
479,6,That must have felt so frustrating.
479,7,It's so frustrating when people pop up like that.
479,8,"It’s just so presumptuous of him, isn’t it?"
479,9,It's just so presumptuous of him.
479,10,It's so frustrating when people just assume things.
479,11,"Yeah, please."
480,0,"Not great, to be honest."
480,1,It's great to see you again!
480,2,"Thanks, I just got it."
480,3,Thanks! I got it on sale.
480,4,"Yeah, it's just awful."
480,5,"Yeah, I can see how you'd feel that way."
480,6,"I don't know, but I'm worried about her."
480,7,"Oh, wow, okay."
480,8,Later.
480,9,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated right now.
481,0,I don't think I'm ready for that.
481,1,That sounds exciting.
481,2,"Oh, that sounds incredibly frustrating to deal with."
481,3,It sounds like this is really bothering you.
481,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit confused and unsure.
481,5,"Wow, that must be hard to see."
481,6,"I'm not sure, I don't really know them."
481,7,That sounds like it could be awkward.
481,8,"Yeah, they're together now."
481,9,I can see why that would be confusing.
481,10,I'm not sure I should be telling you this.
481,11,"I'm sorry, I'm just really confused now."
481,12,I understand that must feel overwhelming.
481,13,I can't help but feel a bit apprehensive too.
481,14,I'm just trying to make something that's easy.
482,0,I missed you so much.
482,1,You look like you've seen a ghost.
482,2,Oh.
482,3,Are you sure?
482,4,I don't know how it got there.
482,5,We have security footage of you.
482,6,"Oh, wow, that's… embarrassing."
482,7,I can see you're feeling really cornered right now.
482,8,I just don't want to get into trouble.
482,9,I understand how frustrating that must be.
482,10,"Oh, thank you!"
482,11,"Yes, and if it goes off again, call the fire department."
482,12,"I know, right?"
482,13,"I know, it's so frustrating when you miss something obvious."
482,14,I'm so frustrated right now!
482,15,"I can't believe it was that easy, right?"
482,16,"I know, right?"
482,17,"I know, right?"
483,0,"Oh, that's a tricky one, isn't it?"
483,1,I can see your frustration.
483,2,You're welcome.
483,3,"Oh no, that's frustrating."
483,4,"I know, it's so frustrating when the phone goes out."
483,5,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
483,6,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
483,7,"Oh, honey."
483,8,"Of course, come on over."
483,9,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
483,10,You sound really stressed out.
483,11,"Oh, honey, I can hear the stress in your voice."
483,12,I can feel your frustration.
483,13,"Okay, I'm listening."
483,14,I can hear the frustration.
483,15,"Oh, wow."
484,0,That sounds frustrating.
484,1,I honestly couldn't say.
484,2,I'm feeling really anxious.
485,0,"Hey, what's wrong?"
486,0,Hey yourself.
486,1,"Nothing, just bills."
486,2,"Oh, really?"
486,3,"Sure, I understand."
486,4,"Oh no, that's awful."
486,5,"Oh, no, that's terrible."
486,6,"Oh, wow, that’s really disheartening news."
486,7,"Oh wow, that's gotta be a real gut punch."
486,8,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
486,9,"I'm so sorry, that's really frustrating."
486,10,"I know, it's such a gut punch."
486,11,That’s such a scary thought.
486,12,"Yeah, that's terrifying."
486,13,That's terrifying.
486,14,"Yeah, it’s a real kick in the teeth."
486,15,"Good luck, I hope they can help."
486,16,Thanks.
486,17,I hope you get some good news.
487,0,"I know, it's so exciting and a little nerve-wracking, isn't it?"
488,0,"It truly is, isn't it?"
488,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating and disappointing.
488,2,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated.
488,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost.
488,4,"I'm sorry, that must have been hard."
488,5,It's okay to not know everything.
489,0,"Yeah, those were good times."
489,1,I miss those times.
489,2,Hi.
489,3,It's good to hear from you.
489,4,"Not great, huh?"
490,0,What's on your mind?
491,0,"No, he didn't."
491,1,That's so bittersweet to hear.
491,2,Thanks.
492,0,I love you too.
492,1,"Yes, they are."
492,2,"Oh, that must be uncomfortable."
492,3,Okay.
493,0,What's wrong?
493,1,"Yes, I am."
493,2,Like a waterfall.
493,3,Is that a threat?
493,4,I’m not sure I should tell you.
493,5,Tell me.
493,6,I get that.
493,7,I guess he’d be too busy to talk then.
493,8,I guess I am.
493,9,Are you serious?
493,10,"Oh, honey."
493,11,That sounds exhausting.
493,12,It sounds like you're really struggling.
494,0,That's a relief.
495,0,"I'm not sure, but I can find out."
495,1,"Oh, you're not entirely sure?"
495,2,I'm really sorry; I'm not sure.
496,0,"Okay, that's a relief."
496,1,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
496,2,"It's alright, it's easy to get turned around."
496,3,I understand how frustrating this must be.
496,4,I'm just really stressed out right now.
496,5,"Oh, that must be so frustrating."
496,6,"I'm so sorry, this is incredibly frustrating."
496,7,"I don't know, but I hope they come soon."
496,8,"That’s not a good sign, is it?"
496,9,"I'm starting to feel a little hopeless, too."
496,10,It sounds like you're really feeling trapped and hopeless right now.
496,11,"I know, it feels like we're stranded."
496,12,It sounds like you're really not okay with that option.
496,13,"I'm really sorry, it sounds like you're in a tough spot."
496,14,I can see this is really frustrating for you.
497,0,"Whoa, that must have been intense."
497,1,I know you feel strongly about this.
497,2,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
498,0,"It's hard, isn't it?"
498,1,"Okay, I'll try."
498,2,That sounds like a wonderful plan.
498,3,I'm trying.
498,4,I just…I can’t do it.
498,5,"Oh, honey, it's not what you envisioned, is it?"
498,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
498,7,I am not laughing!
498,8,"I know, it’s supposed to be a happy moment."
499,0,That's a really hopeful thought.
499,1,I'm so excited!
499,2,I'm so glad to hear you say that.
499,3,It's tough to be happy for others when you're still searching.
499,4,I understand; it's hard to feel secure about it.
499,5,"I mean, it's hard to be hopeful all the time."
499,6,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
499,7,"Yeah, I guess so."
499,8,"That sounds like a heavy thought, like a safety net."
499,9,It's a little scary to think about.
499,10,I can see how that would feel comforting.
499,11,So you're also feeling a little uncertain?
499,12,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to think about."
499,15,"It's a little scary, isn't it?"
499,16,I am!
499,17,"Wow, that must feel amazing!"
499,18,I can’t believe you’ve known all along!
499,19,"Oh my god, really?"
499,20,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine."
499,21,"Oh honey, I can only imagine."
500,0,"No, not right now."
500,1,"Okay, cool, let's go."
501,0,"Good morning to you, too."
501,1,"It was okay, I guess."
501,2,That sounds like a blast!
501,3,It was a blast!
501,4,"Wow, sounds like you had a really great night."
501,5,"No, like, women, women."
501,6,"Oh wow, so you’re saying you weren’t that into it?"
501,7,"Oh, I see."
501,8,"Wow, that's a big change!"
501,9,"Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now."
501,10,"That's awesome, I'm really happy for you!"
501,11,"It felt really good, actually."
501,12,"I'm doing alright, just a little stressed lately."
502,0,"Thank you, it means the world to me."
502,1,We're just so thrilled for you.
502,2,"Yes, it hurts a lot."
503,0,I can't believe you're asking me that.
503,1,"Oh, wow."
503,2,I am completely serious.
503,3,"Oh, wow."
503,4,"Oh, wow."
503,5,I'm so nervous!
503,6,I'm so nervous right now!
503,7,I'm so happy right now!
503,8,I'm so excited!
503,9,I'm so nervous!
503,10,Oh no!
503,11,I'm so nervous!
503,12,I can't believe this is happening!
503,13,"Oh, wow, the anticipation must be killing you!"
503,14,"Oh, honey..."
503,15,"Oh, wow... Okay."
504,0,"Oh, wow, you must feel so relieved!"
504,1,Thank you.
504,2,I can only imagine how you must be feeling right now.
504,3,"Just a cold glass of water, maybe?"
504,4,"Okay, I'll make sure to stay clear of your stomach."
504,5,I'm glad you're feeling okay.
504,6,"Oh no, you poor thing!"
504,7,"Oh, you poor thing, you look like you're about to explode."
504,8,"Oh, you poor thing."
504,9,"Oh, you poor thing, you're in agony, aren't you?"
504,10,You deserve it after all that.
504,11,I think I'm going to be sick.
504,12,I just want you to be happy.
504,13,"You seem pretty worked up, my friend."
505,0,"I know, I wasn't expecting to see you either."
505,1,"Oh, no, that doesn't sound good."
505,2,I know this is a lot to take in.
505,3,What’s going on?
505,4,"Sure, take your time."
505,5,I can see that you're feeling a bit awkward right now.
505,6,"I know you’re worried, but I can’t tell you yet."
505,7,I can see that you're really struggling.
505,8,"I understand, it's a sensitive time."
505,9,"Oh honey, are you alright?"
505,10,I understand this must be difficult to talk about.
505,11,You seem really worried.
505,12,"I know, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how to say this."
505,13,"Oh, honey, you sound really stressed."
505,14,"Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to cause you trouble."
505,15,You must be feeling really overwhelmed right now.
506,0,I just don't see how we can.
506,1,"I know, it's a terrifying thought."
506,2,"I know, it's a terrifying thought."
506,3,"I know, it's hard to imagine, isn't it?"
506,4,I'm so sorry.
506,5,I understand how much that hurts.
506,6,I understand that must feel incredibly painful.
506,7,I understand how much that hurts.
506,8,"I know, it feels like everything is broken."
506,9,I understand.
506,10,I know.
506,11,I don't know.
507,0,That sounds peaceful.
507,1,Sounds like you're feeling a bit constricted right now.
507,2,"That sounds stressful, having to deal with all of that at once."
507,3,"Oh, you did?"
507,4,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed.
507,5,I can see you're feeling a little overwhelmed.
507,6,I hear your confusion.
507,7,It's hard when you feel like you're losing yourself in a relationship.
507,8,"Oh, honey."
507,9,"Oh, you're right, it's him."
507,10,Maybe...
507,11,Are you nervous?
507,12,That sounds like a lot to process.
507,13,I can feel the weight of that on you.
507,14,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
507,15,"Oh, honey."
507,16,That's a big step.
508,0,Hey!
508,2,I'm ready.
508,3,Hi there!
508,4,I'm ready too.
508,5,"I know, it can be a little nerve-wracking."
508,6,"I'm feeling a bit nervous, too."
508,7,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
508,8,"It's alright, it's just a slight change."
508,9,You seem a little unsure.
508,10,"It's not what you were expecting, is it?"
508,11,"Oh, I see."
508,12,You seem a little frustrated.
508,13,"Oh, I see."
508,14,"You're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?"
508,15,"You're feeling a little frustrated, aren't you?"
508,16,It's frustrating when you get it wrong.
508,17,You seem a little flustered.
508,18,I understand.
508,19,"It's alright, we'll get it."
508,20,I understand your frustration.
508,21,"I'm so sorry, I know it's frustrating."
508,22,I understand your frustration.
509,0,Coming!
509,1,I'm so sorry to have to ask you to do this.
509,2,How much do you need?
509,3,"I understand, it's frustrating when you're trying to help."
509,4,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating when you feel like you're being treated unfairly."
509,5,I am just trying to help!
509,6,I can see you're frustrated.
509,7,I can see you're really trying.
509,8,"I know, it's just… frustrating."
509,9,"I know, I know, it's frustrating."
509,10,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
509,11,I understand you're frustrated.
509,12,Are you alright?
509,13,I think she's in labor!
509,14,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
509,15,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
509,16,"Okay, let's go see what we can find."
510,0,"Wow, that must be incredibly disorienting for them."
510,1,"I'm just saying, I don't know, it's just a thought."
510,2,"Oh, wow, that must be tough to see."
510,3,"Oh, wow, that must be tough to see."
510,4,That must be difficult to see.
510,5,"It just makes everything more complicated, doesn't it?"
511,0,"I know, it feels impossible right now."
511,1,I'm so scared.
511,2,I could never hate you.
511,3,I just... I don't want to hurt you.
511,4,"Oh, no, what happened to Marcel?"
511,5,"Oh, no..."
511,6,"Oh, no."
512,0,Hey! How are you doing?
512,1,How are you doing today?
512,2,"I'm feeling a bit down, to be honest."
512,3,That's great to hear!
512,4,"Oh, wow, yeah, I remember that."
512,5,"I feel awful, I'm so sorry."
512,6,"Yes, I remember."
512,7,"Well, I think you should probably give it back."
512,8,"Oh, no, I'm so sorry!"
512,9,I can't believe you don't remember that!
512,10,"Oh no, I did not!"
512,11,"You're really upset, aren't you?"
512,12,"Oh no, are you saying you think I have it?"
512,13,I can't believe you did that!
512,14,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
513,0,I understand how frustrating that must be.
513,1,I already looked there.
513,2,I understand your frustration; it's easy to feel flustered when you can't find something important.
513,3,"I’m sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
513,4,"I'm sorry, this is frustrating."
514,0,"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest."
514,1,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
514,2,I understand.
514,3,"Oh, I can see how that might be a little overwhelming."
514,4,I understand that's not what you were expecting.
514,5,"Oh, wow, that's a bit of a surprise, isn't it?"
514,6,"Oh, wow, that must be disappointing."
514,7,"Oh, wow."
515,0,Hey.
515,1,"Yeah, I am."
515,2,"Oh, I understand."
515,3,"Oh, that's a tough spot to be in."
515,4,"Oh, wow, I can see how that would be frustrating."
515,5,"I'm sorry, I can't talk about that right now."
515,6,"Oh, that's frustrating, I get that."
516,0,You must be exhausted.
516,1,What's wrong?
516,2,I'm just so overwhelmed right now.
516,3,"Sure, I can get a little closer."
516,4,"Oh, no, not again!"
516,5,I understand.
517,0,I'm here.
517,1,What's wrong?
517,2,I don't know if I do.
517,3,"Mmm, does that feel good?"
517,4,I'm so close...
517,5,What's wrong?
517,6,I understand.
518,0,I know it doesn't feel that simple right now.
518,1,I just feel so lost.
518,2,What do you feel you should be?
518,3,I just feel so lost.
518,4,I'm sorry you feel that way.
518,5,I understand.
518,6,I hear the weight of that “nothing.”
518,7,That sounds exhausting.
518,8,"That was something, wasn’t it?"
519,0,I just... I don't know what else to do.
519,1,I can't believe this is happening.
519,2,"I'm so sorry, I understand that must be a shock."
519,3,And then what?
519,4,I'm so confused.
520,0,"Oh, thank goodness!"
520,1,"Okay, take care, and I hope the walk helps."
520,2,"Oh, no!"
520,3,"Oh, Phoebe, are you sure?"
520,4,"Oh, no, what's in there?"
520,5,"Oh, Phoebe, are you okay?"
520,6,"Oh, you're so proud of your knitting, I can tell."
521,0,That sounds…intense.
521,1,"Oh, you actually did it?"
521,2,That must be a heavy burden to carry.
521,3,That must have been frustrating.
521,4,It sounds like you're really disappointed with how things turned out.
521,5,"It really stings, doesn't it?"
521,6,It's rough when you feel like you've been passed over like that.
522,0,Yeah?
522,1,"Okay, I'll wait."
522,2,I understand; it must feel overwhelming.
522,3,"I know, I’m just…overwhelmed."
522,4,I know it's a lot to take in right now.
522,5,"I know, it's just… a lot."
522,6,I know it's hard to stop when you're in the middle of something.
523,0,"I'm sorry, I understand that must be frustrating."
523,1,It's just a lot to take in all at once.
523,2,"It's like everyone else is in on a secret, and you're left out."
523,3,"I'm so sorry, it sounds like you're really overwhelmed."
523,4,"Oh, wow, that must feel like a lot to take in all at once."
523,5,"I just, I can't."
523,6,"I'm so sorry, that really sucks."
523,7,"I understand, it must be hard to feel left out."
523,8,"Oh, honey, I know this must be so frustrating."
523,9,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
523,10,I'm so happy for you!
523,11,"I'm sorry, it's just a lot to take in."
523,12,"Oh, honey, I get it."
523,13,I just feel like I should know.
523,14,"Oh, honey, it's okay to feel that way."
523,15,"I know it's hard, but you'll find out soon."
523,16,"I know, right?"
523,17,"I know, it's frustrating to feel left out."
523,18,"I just don't want to talk about it, okay?"
523,19,Oh no...
523,20,"Oh, no... what about him?"
523,21,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
523,22,"Oh, Phoebe, that's awful."
523,23,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
524,0,Hey yourself.
524,1,Just needed to get out of the house.
524,2,I appreciate you saying that.
524,3,I'm so glad you're feeling that way.
524,4,"I know it's hard, but try to focus on the good things."
524,5,"Oh, wow, you really get it."
524,6,"It's okay, you don't have to pretend."
524,7,"Oh, Phoebe, I can see this is hard for you."
524,8,I'm glad we could talk about this.
524,9,"Oh no, is everything alright?"
524,10,"Oh, I see, that makes sense."
524,11,I understand how that might feel.
524,12,That must be tough to see.
524,13,"Oh, Phoebe."
524,14,"Oh, wow..."
524,15,"I know, it's awful, isn't it?"
524,16,"I know, it’s… it’s awful."
525,0,"Yeah, still out."
525,1,That's frustrating.
525,2,Maybe.
525,3,"Oh, wow."
525,4,"I'm sorry, that must be frustrating."
525,5,"I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it."
525,6,That's sweet.
525,7,I just get that feeling.
525,8,That sounds like a fun challenge.
526,0,"Oh, wow, that's so nice to hear!"
526,1,"Oh, wow, you noticed."
526,2,"Oh, that must be awkward."
526,3,"Wow, that sounds really complicated."
526,4,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
526,5,I can see why that would be unsettling.
526,6,I can see why you'd feel that way.
526,7,I understand this is a lot to take in.
526,8,I can see how exciting this must be for you.
526,9,This must be really confusing.
526,10,I understand that this might be a bit awkward.
526,11,It's hard to feel rejected like that.
526,12,I can see you're really hoping for something.
526,13,You must be feeling really conflicted right now.
526,14,I can see how that would be disappointing.
526,15,That must be really disappointing.
526,16,"Oh, wow, that's gotta sting."
526,17,"Wow, that must feel really disappointing."
526,18,It's like you're a runner up.
526,19,"That stings, I imagine."
526,20,I'm so sorry; that must feel awful.
527,0,I understand you're feeling really upset right now.
527,1,I'm really not in the mood right now.
527,2,I'm so glad.
527,3,That's so sweet.
527,4,I'm really glad you guys worked things out.
527,5,I'm just happy you two are back on good terms.
527,6,You guys are so cute together.
527,7,Okay!
528,0,What's on your mind?
528,1,"Oh, wow, that's a bit of a nerve-wracking question, isn't it?"
528,2,"Oh, honey, that's gotta sting."
528,3,I can understand why you're so excited.
528,4,You must be feeling quite conflicted right now.
528,5,I can hear how much you're struggling with this.
529,0,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly hurtful."
529,1,It must be hard to feel like you're being manipulated.
529,2,It sounds like you're feeling really insecure right now.
529,3,I can see how that would be upsetting.
529,4,I know you feel caught in the middle.
529,5,I understand that you're feeling really hurt right now.
529,6,That must feel really confusing.
529,7,"Oh, wow."
529,8,"Oh, wow, that must feel really awkward."
529,9,It must feel awful to be used.
530,0,"It's okay, I understand."
530,1,I understand this is difficult.
530,2,"Oh, honey."
530,3,I understand this must be a shock.
530,4,I just...I don't understand.
530,5,"Oh, wow."
530,6,"Oh, honey."
530,7,"Oh, wow, that must be incredibly painful."
530,8,I understand wanting to know your roots.
530,9,It must be so confusing and painful to finally have this information.
530,10,I understand this is important to you.
530,11,I understand you're feeling really hurt right now.
530,12,I understand how much this means to you.
530,13,That must be a lot to take in.
530,14,This must be incredibly overwhelming.
530,15,"Oh, wow, that must be a lot to take in right now."
530,16,I can see how much this is hurting you.
530,17,I can see how much that hurts.
530,18,I can see how much this hurts.
530,19,It's okay to feel that way.
530,20,I understand.
530,21,"Oh, honey."
530,22,I understand this must be a lot to take in.
530,23,"Oh, sweetie."
531,0,"I'm not sure, I guess I'm just changing."
531,1,It sounds different.
531,2,I'm not sure I understand.
531,3,"Oh, I see."
531,4,"Oh, I see."
531,5,"Oh, that must have been so uncomfortable."
531,6,"It's okay, I understand."
531,7,"I understand, it must have been a bit unsettling."
531,8,"I understand, it can be a little unsettling to be caught off guard like that."
531,9,I understand.
531,10,"I understand, it’s hard when things don’t go as planned."
531,11,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up about this.
531,12,It must feel awful to feel like you messed up your chances.
531,13,"I understand, it's tough when you feel like you've messed up."
531,14,"I know, it’s just… it’s a lot of pressure, isn’t it?"
531,15,"Oh, wow, this is awkward, isn't it?"
532,0,"Nowhere, just wandering."
532,1,Is something wrong?
532,2,"No, I wouldn't mind at all."
532,3,I understand; sometimes you just need some space.
532,4,"Yeah, it's been a lot to process, hasn't it?"
532,5,I understand; sometimes you just need to clear your head.
532,6,I know this must be frustrating.
532,7,I understand this is frustrating.
532,8,I understand it's frustrating.
532,9,I understand how frustrating that must be.
532,10,I know it's frustrating when you feel like you can't have what you want.
532,11,I can see you're feeling really trapped right now.
532,12,I understand this is frustrating.
532,13,I can see how that would feel exciting and frustrating all at once.
532,14,"You're really romanticizing this, aren't you?"
532,15,I can see you're feeling a little frustrated right now.
533,0,"I understand, that sounds really stressful."
533,1,That sounds like a tricky situation.
533,2,"Yeah, it sounds like she might be lonely."
533,3,"Good luck, I really hope this works."
533,4,I'm glad you understand.
533,5,I'm ready when you are.
533,6,I'm all ears.
533,7,"Oh no, that's a real setback."
533,8,"Oh, wow, that is a change of plans."
533,9,"I appreciate the offer, but no thank you."
534,0,"No, not really."
534,1,"Of course, I'm glad you feel comfortable."
534,2,I'm really grateful.
534,3,"I was just going to say that if you need anything, just let me know."
535,0,I feel like I'm being misunderstood.
535,1,I am but a reflection.
535,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
535,3,I understand your frustration; it's hard to focus when you're feeling that way.
536,0,I know it must feel confusing.
536,1,"I know, and it's just hard to understand sometimes."
536,2,"Oh, right."
536,3,It sounds like you have some strong feelings about Chip.
536,4,"Oh, wow, I can see why that would be frustrating."
536,5,"Yeah, it was a whole ordeal."
536,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds like it could have been humiliating."
536,7,That must have been so embarrassing.
536,8,"Wow, that must feel amazing!"
536,9,I can understand why that would be so tempting.
536,10,I understand.
536,11,That must feel like a huge deal.
536,12,It’s okay to want this.
536,13,"Yes, really."
536,14,"Wow, that's a lot to ask of yourself, isn't it?"
536,15,I'm so happy for you!
537,0,"Oh, is something wrong?"
537,1,I just wanted to say I'm feeling pretty jealous right now.
537,2,"Oh, man, that sounds rough."
537,3,"I get that you're disappointed, I'm sorry."
537,4,"I get it, it's tough when you have a plan and things don't go your way."
538,0,I know it hurts when you feel like someone doesn't care.
538,1,But what?
538,2,It just feels like she doesn't care about my feelings.
538,3,"Oh, honey."
538,4,I know it can be hard when you feel like you're being compared to someone else.
538,5,"I know, it’s hard when you feel like you’re not being seen."
538,6,I'm listening.
538,7,I got it from the Pottery Barn.
538,8,"Oh, wow, that's gotta sting a little."
538,9,"It's just, I can't believe she would do that."
539,0,I miss him too.
539,1,I just hope she's okay.
539,2,It sounds like you're feeling a little out of step with everyone else.
539,3,"It's okay, you don't have to force it."
539,4,"Yeah, it's okay to feel that way."
539,5,I miss her too.
539,6,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
540,0,I can see you're feeling overwhelmed right now.
540,1,I just... I don't know if I can handle this.
540,2,"Oh, honey, that's rough."
540,3,That sounds like a really tough situation.
540,5,I understand; it's hard when you realize you messed up.
541,0,I was really startled.
541,1,"Oh, you weren't a fan?"
541,2,"Oh, are you feeling like things are a bit stale?"
541,3,"I'm not sure, I'm a little nervous to say."
541,4,I'm really sorry to hear you say that.
541,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
541,6,I don't think you like me anymore.
541,7,I'm not sure I can handle that right now.
541,8,"Oh, you're excited!"
541,9,That sounds like a great idea!
541,10,You seem really happy about that.
541,11,I'm listening.
541,12,"I'm feeling a little vulnerable right now, to be honest."
541,13,"I don't know, maybe some role-playing?"
541,14,"Oh, wow."
541,15,I’m just not sure if I’m comfortable with that.
541,16,I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
541,17,"I don’t know, I’m kind of nervous."
541,18,"That sounds exciting, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that."
541,19,"Oh, you do?"
542,0,"Oh, that sounds like a recipe for disaster!"
542,1,That sounds like a frustrating situation.
542,2,That must feel incredibly frustrating.
542,3,"Yeah, I guess it was."
542,4,"Oh, wow, I can only imagine how excited you were!"
542,5,"Thanks, I really appreciate that."
542,6,"Yeah, we're just trying to stay upright!"
542,7,"I'm not sure, I'm just a little shaken up."
542,8,"I know, it's a lot to take in right now."
543,0,I don't want to.
543,1,Hello there.
543,2,Hey!
544,0,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of uncertainty.
544,1,"No, they're not."
544,2,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
544,3,I’m sorry.
544,4,But you still want this.
544,5,But I'm still terrified.
544,6,I would love that.
544,7,"Okay, I'll make the coffee."
544,8,Every time?
545,0,"Oh, you poor thing, having to deal with that."
545,1,"Oh, honey, it's okay, we all make mistakes."
545,2,I just wanted to try something different.
545,3,"Oh, Phoebe, I am so sorry."
545,4,"Oh, wow, that's really sweet of you."
545,5,"Hey, it's okay, Phoebe."
545,6,"Oh no, that's terrible!"
545,7,"Oh, no!"
545,8,"Oh, wow, that's got to be a shock!"
545,9,"Okay, bye, I hope everything's okay."
545,10,I can see you're really stressed right now.
545,11,"I know, it's pretty wild."
545,12,"I'm just, I'm really not feeling like myself."
545,13,What's wrong?
546,0,I'm not sure I understand.
546,1,It's okay to feel that way.
546,2,I don't know.
546,3,I don't know.
546,4,Alright.
546,5,You don't?
546,6,It sounds like you're a bit confused.
546,7,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
546,8,That must be a confusing question.
546,9,"It's a little disheartening, isn't it?"
546,10,I understand why you'd feel that way.
546,11,I don't know.
546,12,It's frustrating when things don't make sense.
546,13,I can see how that would feel frustrating.
546,14,It's frustrating when your body just won't cooperate.
546,15,"It's frustrating when things don't come easily, isn't it?"
546,16,"I know, it can be tough sometimes."
546,17,"Oh, that's tough."
546,18,"I know, right?"
547,0,It sounds like you're really questioning yourself.
547,1,It's like I'm living in an alternate reality.
547,2,That must be a comfort.
548,0,"I know, right? It's a welcome change."
548,1,Me too.
548,2,It sounds like you really need some sunshine.
548,3,"Me too, I love spending time with you."
548,4,"It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
548,5,That must have been a long time ago.
548,6,That sounds like a lovely plan.
548,7,"Oh, shoot, I'd forgotten all about that."
548,10,That sounds stressful.
549,0,"Oh, wow, that's very generous of you."
549,1,Oh.
549,2,"I understand your disappointment, Joey."
549,3,"Wow, thanks!"
549,4,I understand your disappointment.
549,5,Oh.
549,6,I understand it's disappointing when you have your mind set on something.
549,7,"Wow, that's a lot of money to miss out on."
549,8,I can see you're disappointed.
549,9,Ouch.
550,0,"Not great, honestly."
551,0,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
551,1,"Oh, you must be excited to share them!"
551,2,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't think of that."
551,3,I know you're excited for me to try them.
551,4,I can see you're eager for me to try them.
551,5,"You're right, I do tend to forget the rules sometimes."
551,6,I'll meet you in the kitchen then.
551,7,I'll meet you in the kitchen then.
551,8,Just enjoying the peace before the cookie storm!
551,9,I'm a little worried about what you're up to.
552,0,"Oh, that must be really unpleasant for you."
552,1,"Oh, I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
552,2,I understand; it's been a long day.
552,3,"Okay, let's go."
552,4,"Oh, I'm sorry, are you not feeling well?"
553,0,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
553,1,I'm trying.
553,2,"I know, it's frustrating when you feel like you're constantly being watched."
553,3,It's frustrating when you feel like you're missing out.
553,4,It must be frustrating to keep waiting.
553,5,It's frustrating to feel like you're being overlooked.
553,6,I wish I knew.
553,7,"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
553,8,Sounds like it's been a long day.
553,9,Thanks.
553,10,"Yeah, really."
553,11,I can try.
553,12,"It's like you're holding back, you know?"
553,13,"Oh, I see."
553,14,You're getting it!
553,15,"I'm feeling it, too."
553,16,I see.
553,17,"Oh, you feel a bit left out?"
553,18,"Oh, come on, I don't know him."
553,19,"I understand, it's hard when you really want to connect with someone."
553,20,"I know, it's tough when you feel that way."
554,0,"I'm so sorry, I know you're worried."
554,1,"Yes, I'm here."
554,2,"It's okay, I was just surprised to hear a voice."
554,3,I was worried sick.
554,4,I’m just hanging out with my friends.
554,5,"Oh, that sounds fun!"
554,6,"Oh, wow."
554,7,"Yes, it is."
554,8,I’m so sorry.
554,9,I can't believe this is happening to you.
554,10,I can only imagine how upsetting this is.
554,11,I can't believe this is happening.
554,12,I can't believe this is happening.
555,0,What's wrong?
555,1,I'm here.
555,2,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
555,3,You don't understand how much you hurt me.
555,4,"I'm so sorry, Elizabeth."
556,0,Hey.
556,1,What's on your mind?
556,2,I can't imagine how much pain you must be in.
556,3,I'm so sorry.
556,4,I just want to understand.
556,5,Then what?
556,6,What's going on?
557,0,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
557,1,"I'm so sorry, that must be frustrating."
557,2,I understand that can be frustrating.
557,3,I understand that must be frustrating.
557,4,"Oh wow, that's quite a surprise."
557,5,"That sounds really awkward, I’m sorry."
557,6,I'm really glad.
557,7,"It's okay, you can admit it."
558,0,"Oh, you think so?"
558,1,"Oh, honey, I'm so glad you think so."
558,2,"That's so exciting, I hope it does!"
558,3,"I know, I'm just as surprised as you are."
558,4,"No, of course not!"
558,5,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
558,6,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I messed up big time."
558,8,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry, I didn’t mean for this to happen."
559,0,"Oh no, that sounds incredibly mortifying."
559,1,"It was so mortifying, wasn't it?"
559,2,That's mortifying.
559,3,"Instead of... well, you know."
559,4,That's incredibly unsettling.
559,5,That's... intense.
559,6,"Wow, that would be unsettling."
559,7,"Oh, wow, that's mortifying."
560,0,"Coming! I'm just finishing up something, be right there."
560,1,Something I know you'll love.
560,2,"Oh, you know how to make a guy happy."
560,3,I hope you enjoy it!
560,4,I'm so excited!
560,5,"You're welcome, sweetie."
560,6,"Mmm, smells delicious in here."
560,7,"I'm doing alright, just happy to be here with you."
561,0,"Oh, that must have been so disappointing."
561,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been so awkward to witness."
561,2,"Oh, honey, of course, let me see."
561,3,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
561,4,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
561,5,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really awful."
561,6,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
561,7,"Wow, that sounds so uncomfortable."
561,8,I just... I feel like I'm watching a car wreck.
561,9,"Oh, honey, you're really hurting."
561,10,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
561,11,I guess it's hard to know what to believe sometimes.
561,12,I can't believe you'd admit to that!
561,13,"It's okay, you can tell me."
561,14,I get it.
561,15,"Wait, are you okay?"
561,16,I can't believe this is happening.
561,17,Yeah.
561,18,"I don't know, Joey... it's a lot, right?"
562,0,"Oh my goodness, congratulations!"
562,1,Congratulations!
562,2,This is so exciting!
562,3,That sounds exciting!
562,4,I'm just so excited!
562,5,"That's the wedding march, isn't it?"
562,6,"Oh, I see."
562,7,I'm so happy for you both!
562,8,"Yes, I can see you're excited."
562,9,I just want you to be happy.
562,10,I'm so happy for us!
562,11,"It's okay, take your time."
563,0,That's a really big decision to consider.
563,1,That's a really personal decision.
563,2,I'm not sure I'm ready to answer that.
563,3,Really?
563,4,"Really, Mon?"
563,5,"No, but I'm glad to hear that."
563,6,"Oh, well, that's okay."
563,7,"Oh, wow."
563,8,You're very welcome.
564,0,"Oh no, what happened?"
564,1,"No, even worse."
564,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds intense."
564,3,"I know, right?"
564,4,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
564,5,"Oh, that's a bit of a letdown."
564,6,"Yes, it sounds like you have a right to be."
564,7,I'm so lost right now.
564,8,What are they?
564,9,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
564,10,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
565,0,You sound really nervous about this.
565,1,I understand.
565,2,"I understand, it's hard to ask for that."
565,3,Thank you.
565,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like that."
566,0,"I know, it's tough."
566,1,"I know, right?"
567,0,I know how disappointing that must feel.
568,0,"That's a frustrating feeling, I understand."
568,1,"I know, it's frustrating when you lose money."
568,2,"I know, it's frustrating when you lose money like that."
568,3,"Oh, that's such a bummer."
568,4,I miss you too.
568,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful!"
568,6,That must have been so uncomfortable.
568,7,It sounds like you're feeling pretty validated right now.
568,8,That must feel incredibly stressful.
568,9,"I'm so sorry, that's awful."
568,10,I can see why you'd be freaked out right now.
568,11,"You're really freaking out, aren't you?"
569,0,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was making you feel that way."
569,1,"Okay, I will."
569,2,"I just need a minute, okay?"
569,3,"What's wrong, Ross?"
570,0,"Whoa, hey, it sounds like you're really angry."
570,1,"Hey, it's okay."
570,2,I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
570,3,You're welcome.
571,0,"Oh, wow, I can only imagine."
571,1,I understand this is serious.
571,2,I understand this is a really stressful situation.
571,3,I understand this is a difficult situation.
571,4,I understand this is a delicate situation.
571,5,I understand this is a delicate situation.
571,6,This is incredibly stressful.
571,7,I know this is stressful.
571,8,"This is stressful, isn't it?"
571,9,This is incredibly stressful.
571,10,"Oh, thank goodness!"
571,11,I understand this must be hard to process.
571,12,I can see how this must be unsettling.
571,13,I can see why you'd say that.
571,14,"Oh, this must be so unsettling for him."
571,15,I can see how that might be unsettling.
572,0,"Oh, that sounds a little strange."
572,1,"Oh wow, that sounds pretty harsh."
572,2,That sounds really upsetting.
572,3,"Oh honey, are you okay?"
572,6,I'm right here with you.
572,7,"Okay, I understand."
572,8,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly hurtful."
572,9,I can see you're really upset.
572,10,"I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly stressful."
572,11,"You're really scared right now, aren't you?"
572,12,"I'm so sorry, I'm really not."
572,13,"I'm sorry, I'm really not feeling well right now."
572,14,"I just want you to know that I love you, okay?"
572,15,I can tell you're really hurting right now.
572,16,This must be so hard for you right now.
572,17,"You're really upset, aren't you?"
572,18,"Hey, hey, I'm not."
572,19,"I'm scared, too."
572,20,"I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly stressful."
573,0,"Oh, wow, you're thinking about Pat Sajak right now?"
573,1,I'm so sad to hear that.
573,2,"Oh, yes, Alex."
573,3,I miss him too.
573,4,I miss him too.
573,5,"Wow, that's quite a confident statement!"
573,6,You must be feeling pretty confident right now!
573,7,"You're feeling pretty confident right now, aren't you?"
573,8,"Oh, honey, I get it."
573,9,I can see you're getting frustrated.
573,10,I understand you're feeling frustrated.
574,0,"Of course, I can't imagine how frustrating that must be!"
574,1,"Oh, thanks so much!"
574,2,What's wrong?
574,3,"Sure, what's up?"
574,4,Are you okay?
574,5,Are you okay?
574,6,I can tell you're in a lot of pain.
574,7,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really overwhelming."
574,8,"I understand, it's a lot to keep secret."
574,9,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
574,10,"Wow, that must have been a whirlwind of a trip."
574,11,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
574,12,That must have been a lot to keep secret.
574,13,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
574,14,"I'm bursting with excitement for you, but I understand why you'd want to keep it secret."
574,15,I promise.
574,16,"I understand, it's a lot to take in."
574,17,It's so hard to keep secrets like this!
574,18,"It's okay, it's okay."
574,19,"Oh, no, that's awful!"
575,0,Those early school memories can be so vivid.
575,1,"No, Mrs. Cobb."
575,2,"Oh, I see, that's funny."
575,3,"I'm not sure, but it sounds delicious."
576,0,"I know, it feels like everything is falling apart."
576,1,I'm so scared right now.
576,2,I know it's a lot to take in.
576,3,I just don't know if I can.
576,4,Okay.
576,5,No!
576,6,I know this is hard.
576,7,"No, no, no..."
576,8,"I know, this is a lot."
576,9,"Oh, wow."
576,10,"I'm sorry, you're right, that's not fair."
577,0,I'm ready to hear them.
577,1,"Oh, that sounds incredibly painful."
577,2,That sounds really difficult.
577,3,That sounds incredibly difficult.
577,4,"Oh, that sounds incredibly stressful."
577,5,You really think that's how it's done?
577,6,You seem a little disappointed that class is over.
577,7,"You seem a bit down, Mr. Trib."
578,0,"Okay, I understand."
578,1,I'm the one who's asking you to be quiet.
578,2,"Oh, okay."
578,3,"Oh, wow, that must be a shock."
578,4,"I'm really sorry, I didn't know."
578,5,I understand this must be frustrating.
578,6,"This is just… really upsetting, isn’t it?"
578,7,"Oh, wow, that must be really frustrating."
578,8,"I know, it's confusing."
578,9,"Oh, wow, that must feel frustrating."
579,0,"Oh, wow, I haven't seen you in ages!"
579,1,Hey! How are you doing?
580,0,That's a really clever idea; I'm feeling a bit lost right now too.
580,1,"Oh, that's a good point, I hadn't thought of that."
581,0,"I'm feeling a bit stumped myself, honestly."
582,0,I understand how frustrating that must be.
583,0,"I'm so excited, I can barely contain myself!"
583,1,I can tell you're feeling a bit frustrated right now.
583,2,I can tell you're feeling a bit frustrated right now.
583,3,I'm sorry you're disappointed.
583,4,I'm really disappointed.
583,5,"Oh, you're so excited about the presents!"
583,6,You seem really excited!
583,7,You seem really excited!
583,8,I just don't want to ruin the surprise!
583,9,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
584,0,"Oh, wow, that must be frustrating."
584,1,"Oh, that sounds like it might be tough."
584,2,I know this is hard.
584,3,"Okay, I understand."
584,4,I'm just really nervous about everything.
584,5,I'm a little nervous now.
584,6,"No, honey, I'm not."
584,7,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
584,8,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
584,9,I know you're feeling a lot right now.
585,0,It sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt and regret right now.
585,1,I understand your frustration; it’s a lot to process.
585,2,It's just so unfair.
585,3,I'm just so sorry.
585,4,I just don’t know what to do.
585,5,I appreciate you saying that.
585,6,I just feel so lost right now.
585,7,What's wrong?
585,8,"I'm so sorry, it's just... a lot."
585,9,What is it?
585,10,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful!"
585,11,"Oh, honey, are you alright?"
585,12,"Oh no, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
586,0,Yes?
587,0,Hi! How are you doing today?
587,1,"Oh, wow, that's fantastic news!"
587,2,That's fantastic news!
587,3,I'm so happy for you!
587,4,"I know, right?"
587,5,I'm so happy for you!
588,0,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up right now.
588,1,I just feel so ashamed right now.
588,2,"It's okay, we all mess up sometimes."
588,3,I just feel so ashamed.
588,4,"No, I don't think so."
588,5,I feel so ashamed right now.
588,6,It sounds like you're really frustrated with yourself.
589,0,That's a big city.
589,1,It's so unsettling to think about.
589,2,"It's so strange to think about, isn't it?"
589,3,That must have been quite the experience then.
589,4,"It's just a feeling, then."
589,5,That's such a beautiful thought.
589,6,I can feel your excitement!
589,7,That sounds really empowering.
589,8,That’s so powerful.
589,9,"That's a powerful feeling, isn't it?"
589,10,It's okay to feel that way.
590,0,"Wow, that's intense."
590,1,That's not what I was expecting.
590,2,"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself."
590,3,I guess that's a pretty loaded question.
590,4,"I'm glad you're feeling good, but I'm also a little worried."
590,5,That was awful.
590,6,"Oh, thank God."
590,7,"Wow, that's so thoughtful of you."
590,8,It's all right; we can do something else.
590,9,What’s wrong?
590,10,Oh thank God!
590,11,"Oh, wow, that sounds really stressful."
590,12,What?
590,13,"I'm sorry, but this is a lot for you."
590,14,"I don't know if I can, but I'll try."
590,15,"I'm sorry, that's a lot to ask."
590,16,You’d do that for me?
590,17,"Oh, Ross, you're a lifesaver!"
591,0,"No, thanks, I'm just trying to process everything too."
591,1,"Alright, buddy, what's got you so down?"
591,2,"Oh, come on, I was just about to look!"
591,3,I understand.
592,0,We're here for you.
592,1,I can only imagine how stressful this is for you.
592,2,"I'm sorry, that must have been a shock."
592,3,"I just... I'm a little taken aback, that's all."
592,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
592,5,"I'm sorry, that must have been a shock."
592,6,I can see you're really struggling with this.
592,7,"I know this is tough, but let's just breathe."
592,8,"I know, it's just... a lot."
592,9,I can see how upsetting this is.
592,10,I can see why you're upset.
592,11,I can only imagine how conflicted you must feel right now.
592,12,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine how conflicted you must feel right now."
592,13,"I'm sorry, this must be so frustrating for you."
593,0,"I know, it's a lot to think about, isn't it?"
593,1,"I know, it's a lot to handle."
593,2,"Oh, wow, thank you."
593,3,"I know, right?"
593,4,"I know, right?"
593,5,I know it feels like you're stuck in a loop.
593,6,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
593,7,I can see how that would be upsetting.
593,8,It feels like you're really struggling right now.
593,9,It’s okay to feel overwhelmed.
593,10,It's okay to feel overwhelmed.
594,0,What's wrong?
594,1,I'm here.
594,2,What's wrong?
594,3,"Oh, Terry, I'm so sorry to hear that."
594,4,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly difficult."
594,5,I understand you're feeling desperate.
594,6,I understand you're in a tough spot.
594,7,I understand this is difficult.
594,8,I'm just…so tired.
594,9,This must be so difficult for you.
594,10,"Oh, wow, that must be a huge relief!"
595,0,"Oh, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
595,1,I was just trying to get him to stop kicking.
595,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds frustrating."
595,3,I'm just so frustrated right now.
595,4,I can hear the frustration in your voice.
595,5,"I know, it's just so frustrating."
595,6,It sounds like you're feeling pretty defeated right now.
596,0,I understand how frustrating that must be.
596,1,It's frustrating to feel like something you enjoy is only valuable in a certain context.
596,2,"Oh, wow."
596,3,"I understand, sometimes you just need to escape."
596,4,"It's tough when reality doesn't match what you want, isn't it?"
596,5,"Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break your flow."
596,6,"Oh no, that sounds so uncomfortable!"
596,7,"I understand, that must be really scary."
596,8,"I know, it's a truly awful situation."
596,9,"Oh, come on, you know I hate being left alone with them!"
596,10,I understand; it's scary when you feel cornered.
596,11,"I'm scared too, but we have to go."
596,12,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
596,13,"I understand, it must be scary."
596,14,"Oh, honey, you poor thing."
596,15,"I'm so sorry, I know it must be terrifying."
596,16,"This is a lot to deal with all at once, isn't it?"
596,17,"You're right, it does seem like a pretty awful situation."
596,18,"Oh, I think I see what you mean."
596,19,"I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you."
596,20,"I'm so sorry, this is a nightmare."
596,21,"This is all a bit much, isn't it?"
597,0,"Hi, Dad."
597,1,How are you feeling today?
597,2,"Oh no, that sounds frustrating!"
597,3,"I know, I'm sorry, I'm just… feeling a bit lost."
597,4,"I understand wanting to try something new, even if it's not usually your thing."
597,5,"Oh, honey."
597,6,I love you too.
597,7,"I'm glad, Chandler."
597,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
597,9,I can’t even imagine.
597,10,I think I’d be okay with that.
597,11,Yeah.
598,0,That must be so frustrating.
598,1,"No, I didn't mean it like that."
598,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that."
598,3,"It’s okay, I understand you’re feeling defensive."
598,4,I understand; that must be hard.
599,0,"Oh no, that's so disappointing after all your effort."
599,1,I'm so bummed for you!
599,2,"Oh, honey, I can see how frustrating that must be."
599,3,I'm so sorry; that's really frustrating.
599,4,I... I may have.
599,5,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
599,6,"Oh, wow, that’s gotta be a bummer."
599,7,You're so excited!
599,8,"Oh no, what happened to the lasagna?!"
599,9,"Oh no, that's awful!"
599,10,"Oh, that's so frustrating!"
599,11,"Oh no, what happened to your newspaper?"
599,12,"Oh, I'm so glad you liked it!"
599,13,"I understand, it's frustrating when something you care about is taken."
599,14,"I know, right?"
599,15,I love it!
599,16,"I know, right?"
599,17,"Oh, no, what’s wrong?"
600,0,Hello there.
600,1,"Hello, my loves."
601,0,"Oh, wow, you must be so excited!"
601,1,"Right there, by the swings!"
601,2,"Oh, thank goodness."
601,3,"I know, I can't believe it!"
601,4,He really is adorable.
601,5,I can't believe it!
602,0,That's wonderful to hear!
602,1,He really is.
602,2,"I know, it's such a relief."
602,3,"Oh wow, really?"
602,4,"Oh, that must have been tough."
602,5,That must have been difficult to hear.
603,0,...eight whole days.
603,1,That must have been such a relief.
603,2,That's a beautiful story.
603,3,I'm glad you think so!
603,4,That's so cool that it's still celebrated!
603,5,"You loved the story, huh?"
603,6,It sounds like that part was a bit disappointing.
603,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
603,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
603,9,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel that way."
603,10,I can see you're really bummed out.
603,11,I’m sorry you’re feeling down.
603,12,I'm sorry things feel so heavy right now.
603,13,You must be really bummed right now.
604,0,"Thanks, I'm going to need it."
604,1,That's a lot to process all at once.
604,2,I'm so happy for you!
604,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
604,4,I'm not sure I follow.
604,5,I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
604,6,That must be frustrating.
604,7,I can see you're really hurting right now.
604,8,I feel like I'm missing something here.
604,9,It sounds like you're feeling pretty confident right now.
604,10,I would never do that to you.
604,11,That you know about Monica.
604,12,You seem really relieved.
604,13,"Oh, I get it, you're worried about what I might remember."
605,0,Hi there! What's up?
605,1,I understand you're frustrated.
605,2,"I'm sorry, it's just... frustrating."
605,3,You're welcome.
605,4,"I'm excited to meet yours, too!"
605,5,"Yes, really!"
605,6,"I understand that fear, it's tough to put yourself out there."
605,7,It sounds like you're worried about what they might think.
605,8,I understand; it's hard to be vulnerable.
606,0,I don't think so.
606,1,"It's been a while, hasn't it?"
606,2,"Wow, that's amazing, congratulations!"
606,3,"I know, it's crazy, right?"
606,4,"Oh, wow, okay."
606,5,"Yeah, I'm in the play."
606,6,"Wow, that's a huge change from when we were kids."
606,7,"Wow, that must be pretty cool."
606,8,"Wow, that's amazing!"
606,9,I would love to!
606,10,"Wow, that's really something!"
606,11,"I'm so sorry, that must be really hard."
607,0,I'm feeling really down on myself right now.
607,1,I'm really worried about you.
607,2,I can see how frustrated you are.
607,3,I can see how important that feeling is to you.
607,4,"Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry you have to deal with this."
607,5,"Oh, no, what's wrong?"
607,6,I'm so glad.
607,7,I can't believe he's actually calling you.
607,8,I can't believe she shared that with you.
607,9,It sounds like you're feeling a bit defensive right now.
607,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit defensive.
607,11,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by this.
607,12,I can see how that would be a lot to take in.
607,13,"I know, right?"
607,14,It really sounds like you're feeling disappointed.
607,15,I can see that's disappointing.
608,0,What is it?
608,1,"I know, it's sad."
608,2,That sounds incredibly disappointing.
608,3,You're welcome.
608,4,You're welcome.
608,5,I can understand why you'd feel that way.
608,6,I can see how that would be unsettling.
608,7,That's a good one!
608,8,Are you doing okay?
608,9,"Oh, man, I can only imagine how stressed you must feel right now."
609,0,I'm not sure I'm ready to answer that right now.
610,0,I'm so proud of you!
610,1,I'm so glad I could be there for you.
610,2,"Oh wow, I'm so glad you were there!"
610,3,That must have been so strange to realize.
610,4,That's amazing!
610,5,You're my everything.
610,6,"I am so sorry, I didn't mean to be creepy."
610,7,"Hey, it's alright, we've all been there."
611,0,I'm feeling a little clumsy today.
611,1,"Yeah, it's frustrating when you can't do something you enjoy."
611,2,You're welcome.
611,3,You're welcome.
611,4,That sounds frustrating.
611,5,I understand; it's frustrating when you're interrupted.
611,6,I'm so glad you're able to help.
611,7,"Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
611,8,I'm so sorry.
611,9,"It's alright, it happens."
611,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit pressured right now.
611,11,"It's alright, you're probably just a little frustrated."
611,12,That sounds frustrating.
611,13,You seem frustrated.
611,14,That must have been frustrating.
612,0,Hey there.
612,1,I did.
612,2,I'm so anxious right now.
612,3,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, that's terrible timing!"
612,4,"Oh no, that's awful, I'm so sorry."
612,5,"Oh no, I'm so sorry!"
612,6,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, I can only imagine how frustrating that must have been."
612,7,"Oh no, you must be so frustrated right now!"
612,8,"Oh no, you must be so frustrated!"
612,9,"I'm so sorry, that's awful!"
613,0,"Oh, wow, that's a real bummer."
613,1,"Oh, I can see how frustrating that must be."
613,2,I can understand why you're frustrated.
613,3,"Oh wow, it sounds like this recipe is really important to you."
613,4,Nesele Tolouse.
613,5,"Oh, that's a beautiful name."
613,6,"Oh, wow, that’s… a lot to take in."
613,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend."
613,8,It's frustrating when people mispronounce something so important to you.
613,9,"Oh honey, I can only imagine how frustrating that must be."
613,10,"Oh, wow, that must feel incredibly frustrating."
614,0,I think that sounds like a good plan.
614,1,It sounds like you're really happy with the decision!
614,2,Me too!
614,3,"I did, and I'm so glad you noticed!"
614,4,I'm proud of you for making that effort.
614,5,"That's a really tough decision, but I support you."
614,6,"It's so hard to break those habits, isn't it?"
614,7,"It's a tough cycle to break, isn't it?"
614,8,"It's so hard, isn't it?"
614,9,"It's a tough thing to do, isn't it?"
614,10,"I understand, it's tough."
614,11,"It's hard to believe in yourself sometimes, isn't it?"
614,12,I know it seems impossible.
614,13,I'm so proud of you.
614,14,That would be amazing.
614,15,That's a great idea!
614,16,I'm feeling strangely motivated right now.
614,17,I'm so ready!
614,18,I know it's going to be hard.
614,19,"Oh wow, that must make it even harder."
614,20,That must make it even harder.
615,0,That sounds frustrating.
615,1,I can't imagine how hard that must be.
615,2,I understand.
615,3,"I'm sorry, are you okay?"
615,4,I'm so sorry; I can see you're really upset.
615,5,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
615,6,"I'm so sorry, that really sucks."
615,7,It sounds like you're really upset about this.
615,8,I know it feels like a big deal right now.
615,9,"I guess it still stings, though, doesn't it?"
615,10,I get that it's frustrating.
615,11,I get that you're feeling frustrated.
615,12,I can understand why you'd feel that way.
615,13,I can see how much that hurts.
615,14,"I know, it's frustrating when you feel like you're being singled out."
615,15,"I get it, it's frustrating when people focus on something you can't control."
615,16,That's a pretty high bar.
615,17,"I know, it's hard when you feel like you're being singled out."
615,18,I'm just trying to fit in.
615,19,"I'm just saying, it's not a big deal."
615,20,"I understand, it's hard when you feel like you're being singled out."
615,21,"I'm just saying, the customer is always right."
615,22,I feel like I'm being ganged up on.
616,0,"Oh, no, that's so sad!"
616,1,"I know, it's still sad though."
616,2,"Yes, it does."
616,3,"Oh no, I can see why that would be upsetting."
616,4,"I know, it’s hard."
617,0,"Yes, I'm sure."
617,1,I understand that's a difficult position to be in.
617,2,I know it's hard not to know for sure.
617,3,"It's okay to not know for sure, I get that."
617,4,It sounds like you're feeling uncertain about this.
617,5,It sounds like you're feeling uncertain and a little frustrated.
617,6,That's a lot to carry.
617,7,"I get it; you need more than just a ""probably."""
617,8,I know it feels like everything's riding on this.
617,9,"In the end, it's just you."
617,10,"No, it really doesn't."
618,0,"Oh, hello there! That's so sweet."
618,1,He really does.
619,0,"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest."
619,1,You don't have to be.
619,2,"It's not always easy, is it?"
619,3,That must be such a relief.
619,4,"That's a really scary thought, isn't it?"
619,5,I can see why you'd feel that way.
619,6,"I know it's hard to think about, but I'm here for you."
619,7,I know you want to believe that.
619,8,"Oh honey, that sounds really rough."
620,0,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
621,0,It’s no one.
621,1,"Oh, okay."
621,2,I don't know.
621,3,"Oh, wow, that must be exciting for them."
621,4,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go the way we planned."
621,5,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
621,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
621,7,"I don't know, I haven't talked to them."
622,0,Hey.
622,1,I'm just feeling really lost lately.
622,2,"He does look pretty amazing, doesn't he?"
622,3,"Oh, Phoebe."
622,4,It sounds like you're really down on yourself right now.
622,5,It sounds like you're feeling really down about this.
622,6,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration right now.
622,7,"Yeah, it really has been a roller coaster, hasn’t it?"
622,8,"It's okay, hormones can really do a number on you."
622,9,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
622,10,"Yes, it definitely happened to me."
622,11,I can't believe I never knew about this!
622,12,"Oh, honey, that must have been intense."
622,13,That sounds like it was a lot of fun!
622,14,"Oh my God, I was so embarrassed, I almost fainted!"
623,0,What's wrong?
623,1,I hear you.
623,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
623,3,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
623,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
623,5,Hey!
623,6,What's on your mind?
623,7,"You're very welcome, it was a lot of fun!"
623,8,I'm so glad you all had a good time.
623,9,That's so cool!
623,10,It's so good to hear that everyone enjoyed themselves.
623,11,Oh wow.
623,12,"Thanks, I really like it too."
623,13,It must be so exciting!
623,14,That's nice to hear.
623,15,Wow.
623,16,It sounds like that ring holds a lot of meaning for you.
623,17,"Wow, that sounds like an incredible family heirloom."
623,18,"It's so much more than just a ring, isn't it?"
624,0,I can understand why you're so shocked.
625,0,That must be incredibly difficult to face.
625,1,"This is really tough, isn't it?"
625,2,This must be so difficult.
625,3,"It's tough, isn't it?"
625,4,"Oh, wow, that must feel really tough."
625,5,"I understand, it's tough when you both want the same thing."
625,6,"It's tough to be in this situation, isn't it?"
625,7,I'm so hungry I can barely think straight right now.
625,8,"That sounds like a good idea, actually."
625,9,"Yeah, it does."
625,10,That sounds like a nice date.
625,11,"You're really invested in this, aren't you?"
625,12,That sounds stressful.
625,13,"I understand, it's tough when money's tight."
625,14,I get that this is frustrating.
625,15,It sounds like you're feeling a little discouraged.
625,16,I'm feeling a little stressed about this.
625,17,"Oh, Joey."
625,18,"Wow, that's a bit out of my league right now."
625,19,"I don’t think so, man."
626,0,Hey there.
626,1,How are you feeling today?
626,2,How are you doing today?
626,3,You're very welcome.
626,4,"Okay, I understand."
626,5,"I appreciate that, but I'm good, thanks."
626,6,I know the feeling.
626,7,"No, I'm really not."
626,8,"Take it easy, you don't want to push yourself."
626,9,"Yeah, it can be a lot to handle."
626,10,"Take it easy, try to stay cool."
626,11,I'd like that very much.
626,12,I'm glad you like it here.
626,13,It feels… safe.
627,0,"Oh, wow, that must have been tough to hear."
628,0,What's wrong?
628,1,"Oh no, that's terrible!"
628,2,"Wow, that's exciting!"
628,3,"Wow, that's a pretty serious find!"
628,4,"Wow, that must have been a long journey."
628,5,"Wow, that must have been a long haul."
628,6,I can't believe you have to work with that.
628,7,"Oh no, are you alright?"
628,8,I know how frustrating that can be.
628,9,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
628,10,That sounds incredibly frustrating!
628,11,Sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated.
628,12,That sounds like a frustrating situation.
628,13,Of course!
629,0,That sounds like a very important rule for Funny Clown.
629,1,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
629,2,I understand you're trying to make things fun.
629,3,That sounds like a lot of fun.
629,4,That sounds really special.
629,5,I know you want him to be happy.
629,6,I'm glad you think so.
629,7,That's so thoughtful of you.
629,8,That's so sweet.
629,9,I'm so glad you feel loved.
629,10,That must have been unexpected.
629,11,Are you okay?
629,12,I can hear the worry in your voice.
629,13,Sounds like you're looking forward to it.
629,14,Sounds like a plan!
629,15,"Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
629,16,I can see why you're upset.
629,17,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
630,0,"Thank you, that's so thoughtful of you."
630,1,"You're very welcome, dear."
630,2,"A little bit, yes."
630,3,"Oh, good, I'm glad."
630,4,"That’s so thoughtful of you, Monica."
630,5,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it was that bad."
630,6,"I'm so sorry, I know that smell can be unpleasant."
630,7,I'm on it!
630,8,"Oh, great."
630,9,Oh no!
630,10,"Oh my god, really?"
630,11,"Oh Phoebe, I’m so sorry."
630,12,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, Phoebe."
630,13,"Oh, Phoebe."
630,14,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process."
631,0,"Oh wow, that's a huge moment!"
632,0,"I know, it's hard to believe right now."
632,1,"Oh, honey."
632,2,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
632,3,"I'm just shocked, that's all."
632,4,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
632,5,"Oh, honey, you must be so conflicted right now."
632,6,I feel like I'm in a nightmare.
632,7,"I know, it doesn't make any sense."
632,8,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
632,9,"Oh, honey."
632,10,I don't know what to do.
632,11,"Oh, honey."
632,12,I don't know anymore.
632,13,"Oh, honey."
632,14,I'm just so scared.
632,15,"Oh, honey."
632,16,I just don't know anymore.
632,17,"Oh, honey."
633,0,"It was more like we were pulled apart, slowly, painfully."
633,1,"I'm sorry, that must be difficult."
633,2,"I know, it's hard to believe, isn't it?"
633,3,I can see how much you love it.
633,4,Thank you.
633,5,That’s wonderful.
633,6,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
633,7,"I'm not sure, I haven't seen him."
633,8,I can't believe this is happening.
633,9,What's wrong?
634,0,I understand this is important to you.
634,1,Thank you.
634,2,"Oh, wow, that must have felt really good."
634,3,I'm sorry you feel that way.
634,4,"Oh, honey, I get it."
634,5,"I know, and it's hard to see him grow up, isn't it?"
634,6,I know you want him to be safe.
634,7,"I'm sorry, that really sucks."
634,8,"I understand, it sucks."
635,0,"Oh, wow, you seem really excited!"
635,1,"Oh, you just wouldn't believe it."
635,2,I understand the excitement; it's tempting to want to see what's inside.
635,3,I can’t believe you’re actually going to try this!
635,4,"Wow, oranges, huh?"
635,5,I'm so nervous right now.
635,6,"Oh, no, here we go."
635,7,Here you go.
635,8,"Oh, I understand, it can be frustrating when you can't see something clearly."
635,9,"Oh, you must be so relieved!"
636,0,Okay!
636,1,What's on your mind?
636,2,That sounds like a really tough realization to come to.
636,3,That's a really positive way to look at things.
636,4,That's a really specific dream.
636,5,That sounds like a lot to process.
636,6,"That sounds like a lot of pressure, but also exciting."
637,0,I feel so anxious right now.
637,1,"Oh no, you're worried about the technicality?"
637,2,"I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
637,3,"I don’t know, I guess I’m just really disappointed."
637,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost right now.
637,5,"I'm just really frustrated right now, and I'm sorry."
637,6,I can tell you’re really upset.
637,7,I can’t believe this is happening.
637,8,I think you're really frustrated right now.
637,9,I can't believe you're doing this.
637,10,"Okay, I get it, you're feeling a bit stressed about this."
637,11,Alright.
638,0,"Yes, sweetheart?"
638,1,I miss you so much.
638,2,"Hey, kiddo."
638,3,I miss those days too.
638,4,"I know, sweetheart, it's a lot to take in."
638,5,"Oh, Dad…"
638,6,I know it's hard.
638,7,I understand; it must be hard to let go.
638,8,It sounds like you're really looking forward to revisiting those memories.
638,9,"It's a little overwhelming, isn't it?"
638,10,"I know, it's hard to believe how quickly time passes."
638,11,I miss those days too.
638,12,"I know, right?"
639,0,"Good, I'm glad you were able to do that."
639,1,"I'm glad you're here, Ben."
639,2,Ready as I'll ever be!
639,3,"Okay, here it comes."
639,4,I'm here with you.
639,5,Ouch!
639,6,Great job!
639,7,"It's hard to tell with all the smoke, isn't it?"
639,8,"Okay, I'm here with you."
639,9,I'm so glad!
639,10,"Oh no, I'm so sorry!"
640,0,"Thank you, I'm glad you find it impressive."
640,1,"Tell me more about that, I'm intrigued."
640,2,"It was a nightmare before, honestly."
640,3,Is something wrong?
640,4,"Yes, those are the ones."
640,5,I bet it did.
640,6,I can see how you might be concerned about that.
640,7,"Yes, I have."
640,8,It sounds like you value that mentorship a great deal.
640,9,It sounds like you really appreciate Rachel's thoughtfulness.
640,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit unsure of yourself right now.
640,11,I understand that you have been working hard.
640,12,That sounds challenging.
640,13,And you clearly grasp the importance of that.
640,14,I understand.
640,15,It sounds like you really enjoy that aspect of the job.
640,16,That sounds a little uncomfortable.
641,0,"Yes, I do."
641,1,"I did, I told her you weren't feeling well."
642,0,"Thank you, that means a lot to me."
642,1,"Yes, you do, and it lights up the whole room."
642,2,I don't think I can do that.
642,3,You got this.
642,4,"I'm sorry, that must be frustrating."
643,0,"I don't know, but I hope he's okay."
643,1,"Hey, what's wrong?"
643,2,"Okay, okay, I'm going."
643,3,I just do.
643,4,I just wanted to see you.
643,5,It's just that I wasn't expecting her.
643,6,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a lot of work."
644,0,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really upsetting."
644,1,"Oh no, what happened next?"
644,2,"I'm so sorry, I know you're upset."
644,3,"Oh no, that sounds frustrating."
644,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been really tough to watch."
644,5,That must have been really confusing.
644,6,It sounds like you're really shocked.
644,7,I can only imagine how shocking that must have been.
644,8,I can't believe this actually happened!
644,9,I can't believe you're still bringing that up!
644,10,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
645,0,"Of course, I will."
645,1,"Thank you, I really appreciate that."
645,2,I know you're not.
645,3,"It's okay, you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed."
645,4,"Oh honey, what happened?"
645,5,"Oh honey, that must feel absolutely terrifying."
645,6,"Oh honey, you must be feeling so overwhelmed right now."
645,7,I'm just so scared of messing up.
645,8,I'm not going anywhere.
645,9,I'm right here.
645,10,I'll be right back.
645,11,I'm here.
645,12,It's okay to be scared.
645,13,"Oh honey, I'm right here."
645,14,I think the baby is coming!
645,15,You seem a little frazzled.
645,16,"Oh honey, are you feeling a little overwhelmed right now?"
646,0,"Oh wow, that's a big decision!"
646,1,"I'm so nervous, I feel like I'm going to throw up!"
646,2,I'm so excited and nervous for you!
646,3,I'm so nervous!
646,4,I'm so glad to hear that.
646,5,I'm so sorry to keep you in suspense!
646,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a tough situation."
646,7,"Yeah, I can see how that might be a little disappointing."
646,8,That would be so amazing!
646,9,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
646,10,I'm so excited to hear what you think!
646,11,I know it would be so cool.
646,12,That's a really thoughtful idea.
646,13,I'm glad you think so.
646,14,I am so excited to hear!
646,15,"Oh no, I'm so excited!"
646,16,"Well, I guess it's because I've been thinking about it, too."
646,17,Oh.
646,18,"Oh, honey, no."
646,19,"Oh, wow."
646,20,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
646,21,I'm so glad you think so.
647,0,"Wow, that sounds like a really frustrating situation."
648,0,"I know, it's everything all at once, isn't it?"
648,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
648,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
648,3,It sounds incredibly frustrating to have to deal with that.
648,4,I can understand why that would be frustrating.
648,5,I can't believe you would think that.
648,6,That must have been a really frustrating time for you.
649,0,I just needed to get out for a bit.
649,1,"Oh, Joey, that's so thoughtful of you."
649,2,You're very welcome.
649,3,You remembered.
649,4,I hope you like it.
649,5,"Oh, Joey..."
649,6,"Oh, you must be exhausted."
649,7,"I got you, I'm sorry."
649,8,I'm so glad you're happy!
649,9,I'm so glad you think so!
649,10,"Oh, wow, that sounds uncomfortable."
649,11,"I know, it's just… a lot."
649,12,I’m glad you like it.
649,13,"I know, right?"
649,14,I can pick that up later.
649,15,You’re glowing.
649,16,"Oh, so you're not the only one with a roommate?"
649,17,He is.
649,18,I'll try.
649,19,"Well, he's got a certain charm, I guess."
649,20,"Oh, so it's like that, huh?"
649,21,"It's not always easy, is it?"
649,22,"Oh, that must be a relief!"
649,23,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
650,0,"Yeah, it sounds like he was really out of line."
650,1,It's frustrating when someone acts like that.
650,2,It's frustrating when people act like that.
650,3,I just feel so defeated right now.
650,4,"I'm sorry, that must sting."
650,5,"You're right, it's easy to get defensive when we feel called out."
650,6,"The difference is, I'm not as bad as *him*."
650,7,That was a low blow.
650,8,That's fantastic!
651,0,"Oh, that sounds disappointing."
651,1,"Oh, that's so frustrating!"
651,2,"Oh, that's frustrating!"
651,3,"Yeah, it's frustrating when things don't go smoothly."
651,4,I'm sorry things are so difficult right now.
651,5,I'll miss you too.
651,6,"That sounds frustrating, I understand."
651,7,I can't believe you're going through this.
651,8,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
651,9,"Oh, that would be a lot to deal with."
651,10,I'm here for you.
651,11,"Oh, honey."
651,12,You seem really frustrated.
652,0,I'm so sorry you're feeling that way.
652,1,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly overwhelming."
652,2,I can only imagine how unsettling that must be.
652,3,I know.
652,4,"I'm so sorry, it must feel like an eternity."
652,5,I understand that feeling.
652,6,I'm so glad you noticed.
652,7,"You're really taken with her, aren't you?"
652,8,I'm too nervous to even move.
652,9,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
652,10,I'm just so awkward when I'm trying to be cool.
652,11,"I know that feeling, of being tongue-tied and unsure."
652,12,"You're really down on yourself, aren't you?"
652,13,"You're right, it's a tough feeling."
652,14,I don't know... maybe it's just not in the cards for me.
652,15,"Yes, I do."
653,0,"Alright, I'm ready."
653,1,What do you think?
653,2,I'm here.
653,3,I'm so glad you're enjoying this.
653,4,I understand.
654,0,"It's okay, I understand."
654,1,I feel terrible; I really do.
654,2,I understand you're feeling really bad right now.
654,3,"I know, I know, I messed up badly."
654,4,"I don’t know, Chandler… I just… I’m really hurt."
654,5,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
654,6,Okay.
654,7,I'm so relieved.
654,8,I can't believe this is happening.
655,0,I understand that feeling.
655,1,That's a surprise!
655,2,That’s a real bummer.
655,3,"This is terrible, I know."
655,4,I’m glad I could do that for you.
655,5,It’s truly heartbreaking.
655,6,"It's so frustrating, isn't it?"
655,7,This really sucks.
655,8,"I'm glad you feel that way, but I'm still so conflicted."
655,9,"Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?"
655,10,I'm glad you think so.
655,11,"I understand, it's frustrating."
655,12,I am so sorry.
655,13,I shouldn't want this so badly.
655,14,I just feel so frustrated right now.
655,15,I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.
656,0,"I know, but it doesn't always feel that way, does it?"
657,0,I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about that right now.
657,1,"Oh, I see, that must feel a bit awkward."
657,2,"It can be fun to imagine, right?"
657,3,"Wow, that's so exciting!"
657,4,"Oh wow, congratulations!"
657,5,"Wow, that's exciting!"
657,6,That's so soon!
657,7,"I know, I'm starting to get so stressed!"
657,8,I'm so excited for you!
657,9,"Oh, that's great!"
657,10,"Oh wow, that must have been unexpected."
657,11,"Yeah, I can imagine how that might be shocking."
657,12,"Oh, that sounds like a lot to process!"
657,13,"Oh, that would be so fun!"
657,14,"Oh, wow, that's a big difference!"
657,15,"I know, right?!"
657,16,What?
657,17,"Oh, wow, that's so cool!"
657,18,I hear you.
657,19,"Oh no, not the dreaded ""other color"" question."
658,0,That sounds like a really special memory for you.
658,1,"I know, right?"
658,2,That sounds like a truly special connection.
658,3,"Not yet, I'm still riding this high."
658,4,"I know, it’s terrifying, but also really exciting, isn't it?"
658,5,I'm so nervous for you right now.
658,6,"You're right, it's agonizing to wait."
658,7,"It's a tough call, for sure."
658,8,It's tough when you're excited but also trying not to mess things up.
658,9,"You're right, it's a delicate balance."
658,10,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
658,11,"You're really conflicted, aren't you?"
658,12,That must have been so disappointing.
658,13,That must have been so frustrating.
658,14,"Oh, wow..."
658,15,"Wow, that must have been awkward."
658,16,That sounds mortifying.
658,17,"Oh man, that's rough."
658,18,"I see them, but I don't understand what's happening!"
658,19,"Oh, wow, this is so nerve-wracking!"
658,20,"You're really worried about this, aren't you?"
659,0,"It's a long story, and not a very happy one, to be honest."
659,1,"Oh wow, that's interesting, and a little surprising."
659,2,"I'm sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
659,3,It sounds like you're feeling really stressed and apologetic right now.
659,4,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
659,5,"No, I don't think it would be weird at all."
659,6,I can hear the worry in your voice.
659,7,It sounds like you're feeling a bit conflicted about it all.
659,8,I'm glad you asked her.
659,9,It sounds like you're really trying to be strong for everyone.
659,10,"It's okay, you don't have to if you don't want to."
659,11,"It's okay, we can make room."
659,12,I'm so glad you're here.
659,13,"Okay, okay, we can make room."
659,14,I can't believe they're making you do this.
659,15,I'm glad you're here.
659,16,"Hi, Carol."
659,17,Hi Carol.
659,18,"Oh, that's lovely."
659,19,"You seem a little down, Carol."
660,0,"Okay, I'm here."
660,1,"Oh, wow."
660,2,I was really scared.
660,3,I can imagine how much you wanted it.
660,4,"Oh, that's disappointing."
660,5,"Oh, that must have been awful."
660,6,I bet that felt awful.
660,7,It sounds like it really hurt.
660,8,It's good that you can see how far you've come.
660,9,"That’s a really nice feeling, isn’t it?"
660,10,It's nice to feel understood.
660,11,Let's go.
660,12,"I'm so glad, let's go."
660,13,I'm glad you're feeling good about this.
660,14,I'm so sorry.
660,15,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
661,0,I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.
661,1,"Oh, come on, you're just trying to make this harder."
661,2,I can see how that would be frustrating.
661,3,"Oh, are you worried about the birds?"
661,4,It sounds like you're worried about the birds' comfort.
661,5,"I'm sorry, I'm just not sure what to do."
661,6,"Oh, you really want to find the right thing, don't you?"
661,7,I can see why you're frustrated.
661,8,I just want you to be happy with it.
661,9,"I'm sorry, I know you miss Kip."
662,0,"Yes, Bijan for men."
662,1,"Yes, it's a classic."
662,2,That sounds really nice.
662,3,"Oh, okay."
662,4,"Oh, I see."
662,5,"Yeah, maybe."
662,6,That sounds really frustrating.
663,0,I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
663,1,"They're so good together, aren't they?"
663,2,"I know, it's so sad."
663,3,You sound so excited!
663,4,I appreciate that.
663,5,Thank you.
663,6,I feel so lucky to have you.
663,7,I...
663,8,Just chillin'.
663,9,"Yeah, I think so!"
664,0,"I don't know, and that's what's scaring me."
664,1,That sounds incredibly painful.
664,2,I just don't know if there's anything left to work with.
664,3,"It's tough to feel like you have no control, isn't it?"
664,4,"I know it's hard to face, but it sounds like you're hurting."
664,5,"I get that you're trying to lighten the mood, but you're really hurting right now."
664,6,"I'm sorry, that's a tough one."
664,7,He almost drowned after eating a chili dog.
664,8,"Oh, I see, you're feeling a bit helpless right now."
665,0,That's wonderful news!
665,1,"That's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?"
665,2,I'm so excited for you!
665,3,"Alright, I'll be waiting here with you."
665,4,"Yes, hopefully, we'll have a few good ones to choose from."
665,5,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
665,6,I can see why you're feeling overwhelmed right now.
665,7,That's a lot to take in.
665,8,I understand how discouraging that must feel.
665,9,"Oh honey, that sounds incredibly disheartening."
665,10,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
665,11,I can see how determined you are to make this happen.
665,12,I understand how much pressure you're feeling right now.
665,13,"Oh, honey, that's a lot of pressure to put on yourselves."
665,14,I understand that this is a lot of pressure.
665,15,"That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
665,16,"Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry."
665,17,"I know, this is a lot to take in."
665,18,That sounds really overwhelming and stressful.
666,0,Hey there! What's up?
666,1,How are you doing?
666,2,"Oh no, that's the worst when you're hungry!"
666,3,"That's really disappointing, I'm sorry to hear that."
666,4,"I know, it's so frustrating when your go-to spots are unavailable."
666,5,"I'm really frustrated too, I was looking forward to some good food."
666,6,"I'm sorry, I know how frustrating that can be."
666,7,"Oh, I'm sorry, Danny, I just miss Johnos."
666,8,"Oh, that's a bummer, especially with the gala."
666,9,I'm sure you can come up with something.
666,10,I guess that's a good point.
666,11,"That sounds frustrating, like a real letdown."
666,12,What's up?
666,13,"Oh, good!"
666,14,"Of course, anytime!"
666,15,You sound excited!
666,16,"Oh, I miss him."
667,0,"That's so sweet, thank you."
667,1,I love you too.
667,2,I understand the need for something familiar.
667,3,That sounds... concerning.
667,4,I'm so glad we found something!
667,5,"Oh, honey."
667,6,Sounds like you're feeling a little stuck.
667,7,"Wow, that's a big ask."
667,8,"I know, it feels wrong, doesn't it?"
667,9,I feel like I'm being pressured into something I'm not comfortable with.
668,0,That sounds tough.
668,1,I'm trying.
669,0,"Not much, honestly, just feeling a bit down lately."
669,1,That's great news!
669,2,"Yeah, I'm really nervous about it."
669,3,I went to the beach.
669,4,"Wow, that sounds amazing."
670,0,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
670,1,"I'm sorry, I understand."
670,2,"I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were worried."
670,3,"I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have just left."
670,4,"Hey, it's okay, you're safe now."
670,5,"Oh, honey."
670,6,"Oh honey, are you okay?"
670,7,"I know, I know, but you have to pull it together."
670,8,"Oh honey, it sounds like you're really struggling right now."
670,9,"I hear the frustration in your voice, I do."
670,10,I understand.
670,11,"Oh, honey."
670,12,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry."
670,13,"Oh, honey, that sounds rough."
670,14,"Oh, honey."
670,15,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
671,0,It sounds like you really appreciate the technical aspects of his work.
671,1,I can see how that might feel a bit overwhelming.
671,2,"Oh, I hear you; sometimes it's hard to focus."
671,3,"Oh, you're feeling a little overwhelmed, aren't you?"
671,4,"It's okay, we all have those moments."
671,5,I feel so overwhelmed right now.
671,6,You seem a little overwhelmed right now.
671,7,"I'm sorry, I know you're feeling overwhelmed."
671,8,I appreciate you noticing my effort.
671,9,"Wow, that sounds intense!"
671,10,That sounds incredibly challenging!
671,11,I can see how that would be frustrating.
671,12,That must have been quite the role!
671,13,"You know, I'm kinda feeling a little overwhelmed right now, too."
671,14,It's amazing how you can still focus on the art with all that going on!
671,15,"I know, I know, I get carried away sometimes."
671,16,"I can see that you're really excited, but let's stick to the script."
671,17,I can see how frustrating this is for you.
672,0,What's wrong?
672,1,I just... I don't know.
672,2,"Oh, no, what's wrong?"
672,3,"Yeah, I'm done."
672,4,"Oh, wow, I understand wanting to be thorough."
672,5,"I know, I know, and I feel terrible."
672,6,I understand.
672,7,"Yes, it does."
672,8,"It's okay, you don't have to be sorry."
672,9,I know this is hard.
672,10,I understand.
672,11,"I just got so caught up in the details, I guess."
672,12,It sounds like you're feeling really conflicted right now.
672,13,"I’m so sorry, I know how much this means to you."
672,14,I'm just… really nervous.
672,15,I'm just trying to understand.
673,0,I know this must be hard to hear.
673,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
673,2,"I know, it's a lot to process."
673,3,"Wow, that must feel like a lot of change."
673,4,I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
673,5,I can't believe you're going through this again.
673,6,"Oh, Ross, I can only imagine how that felt."
673,7,"Oh, Ross."
673,8,"Oh, Ross."
673,9,I can't imagine how confusing and overwhelming that must be.
673,10,This must be so overwhelming for you.
673,11,I understand this must be a lot to process.
673,12,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by all of this.
673,13,I understand this is a lot to process.
673,14,It must be overwhelming.
673,15,"Okay, I understand."
673,16,It sounds like you're really hoping this can be resolved quickly.
673,17,"Oh, boy."
673,18,"It’s going to be a long day, isn’t it?"
673,19,I understand this is difficult.
673,20,"Oh, Ross."
674,0,"Oh, wow, that's a lot."
674,1,"Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun, actually."
674,2,"Oh no, cursed money? That's unsettling."
674,3,"It's just a joke, right?"
674,4,"Oh, that's a little intense, isn't it?"
674,5,You really think so?
674,6,"Oh, honey."
674,7,"I hope the movie's good, then."
674,8,"You're right, it's always something, isn't it?"
675,0,I don't know if I'm ready.
675,1,I'm so ready.
675,2,"I understand, it's important to feel confident."
675,3,"Oh, man, I can see how that would be frustrating."
675,4,You're welcome.
675,5,"I get it, it's easy to mix things up sometimes."
676,0,I understand how difficult that must be.
676,1,"I know, it must feel like a lot to take in."
676,2,I know this must be incredibly difficult to hear.
676,3,I don't know how to tell her either.
676,4,It sounds like you're really hurting right now.
676,5,I don't know how I'm going to do this.
676,6,This must be so incredibly difficult for you.
676,7,"This is all really hard, isn't it?"
676,8,I can't believe this is happening.
676,9,"I am so sorry, this sounds incredibly painful."
676,10,I can't believe you're saying that.
676,11,"This is not fair, I have a right to be angry."
676,12,I understand how incredibly frustrating that must be.
676,13,I'm just so hurt.
676,14,I can't believe this is happening.
677,0,It sounds like you're really impressed.
677,1,"It's just so charming, isn't it?"
677,2,That must have been so upsetting to watch.
677,3,"Oh, right, that must have been so devastating for her."
678,0,I'm here for you.
678,1,I'm glad you're here.
678,2,You sound a little down.
678,3,Hey.
678,4,Hey!
678,5,What's up?
678,6,"Oh, hey, Monica."
678,7,I'm so nervous.
678,8,Hi.
678,9,Hi.
678,10,"Oh, wow!"
678,11,Okay.
678,12,"I know, it can be overwhelming sometimes."
678,13,That sounds frustrating.
678,14,"Not really, no."
678,15,That sounds... nice.
678,16,That sounds like fun!
678,17,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot to handle."
678,18,That sounds... complicated.
679,0,"Alright, I'm here."
679,1,Okay.
679,2,"Oh, wow, that's exciting!"
679,3,You're welcome!
679,4,"Oh, well, that's a bit of a bummer."
679,5,"That sounds exciting, but also a little nerve-wracking."
679,6,That sounds exciting and a little nerve-wracking all at once.
679,7,What's up?
679,8,I can see how exciting that must be!
679,9,I'm so excited for you!
679,10,"It's okay, we can help you prepare!"
679,11,"Thanks, I really appreciate that."
679,12,It’s okay to feel a little overwhelmed.
679,13,"It's okay to feel nervous, Joey."
679,14,"You're feeling a little overwhelmed right now, aren't you?"
679,15,"I know, it's a lot to take in all at once."
679,16,"I'm here for you, always."
680,0,"No need to apologize, I understand."
680,1,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
680,2,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
680,3,What's wrong?
680,4,"Oh, wow, that's tough."
680,5,That's really thoughtful of you.
680,6,"I know, it's just... a lot to deal with, huh?"
680,7,"No, I need you to stay with me, okay?"
680,8,"You're so sweet, Pheebs."
680,9,I understand that you're trying to be considerate.
680,10,"Oh, Monica, you're the best!"
680,11,"Oh, you're sweet, Rach."
680,12,"Oh Monica, that's so thoughtful of you."
680,13,I just want you to be comfortable.
680,14,I can only imagine.
681,0,"Okay, but I'm still scared."
681,1,"Oh, no worries, accidents happen."
681,2,"Oh, it's okay, little guy, we'll find your person."
681,3,I know you're upset.
681,4,I didn't think of that.
681,5,"Oh, you're really worried about him, aren't you?"
682,0,I understand.
682,1,That sounds really reassuring.
682,2,I understand; it must feel a little unsettling.
682,3,"I understand, it can be hard."
682,4,"I understand, like this."
682,5,I know he is.
682,6,He truly is something special.
682,7,"Oh, you must be so disappointed."
682,8,"He's captivating, isn't he?"
682,9,"It's disappointing when they don't do much, isn't it?"
682,10,"It's still nice, though."
682,11,I would love to.
682,12,"Okay, let's go."
682,13,"Okay, see you later."
682,14,"It's hard to say goodbye, even for a little while."
683,0,"I'm really nervous, though."
684,0,You're very welcome.
684,1,"Oh no, that's frustrating!"
684,2,"Oh no, that's incredibly frustrating!"
685,0,I feel so incredibly disappointed.
685,1,"Oh, no, that sounds stressful."
686,0,"Oh, that's a big deal, wanting to protect it like that."
686,1,Thank you.
686,2,I'm happy to help.
686,3,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
686,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated.
686,5,I know you’re trying to help.
686,6,I know how important this is to you.
686,7,I'm so glad I could be.
686,8,"Of course, it was no problem."
686,9,"Thank you, I really appreciate that."
686,10,"It's okay, I understand you're stressed."
686,11,"I'm sorry, I just...I'm a little stressed."
687,0,"Yes, that is correct."
687,1,"Ugh, I hate conference calls."
687,2,You're welcome.
687,3,"That's a bit abrupt, isn't it?"
687,4,What's wrong?
687,5,What's wrong?
687,6,See what?
687,7,"I know, it's frustrating when people don't see what's right in front of them."
688,0,I can only imagine how vulnerable you feel right now.
689,0,"Hey Chip, what's up?"
689,1,"Hey, are you okay?"
689,2,"I'm sorry, I don't know who that is."
689,3,"Okay, I understand."
689,4,I understand.
689,5,"Oh, I see."
689,6,"I don't know, I'm so confused."
689,7,"Oh, wow, you still think he's cute?"
689,8,"I know, right?"
689,9,"Wow, that's so exciting!"
689,10,What did he say?!
689,11,"I know, sometimes those reports can be a real drag."
689,12,"No, I just have to read it for work."
689,13,I can't believe he called!
689,14,"Oh, you’re so excited!"
690,0,"Thank you, it smells lovely."
690,1,You're very welcome.
690,2,I'm glad you like it.
690,3,"Me too, I love making it for you."
690,4,I'm happy you're happy.
690,5,I just remembered I forgot to buy milk.
690,6,"Oh no, I'm so sorry!"
690,7,"Oh my gosh, are you sure?"
690,8,"Oh my gosh, are you serious?"
690,9,Are you sure?
691,0,It sounds like you're really drawn to her.
692,0,"It's alright, I understand."
692,1,That's really sweet of you to say.
693,0,I understand.
693,1,That must be frustrating.
693,2,"I understand, it's frustrating when you feel taken advantage of."
693,3,"Oh wow, that sounds like a really tough situation."
693,4,That sounds like a really difficult situation.
693,5,I understand that you're frustrated.
694,0,That's fantastic!
694,1,That's fantastic!
694,2,"Oh no, I don't know!"
694,3,I really appreciate you saying that.

695,5,I can hear the frustration.
695,6,"I know, it's so frustrating."
696,0,"Sure, go ahead."
696,1,"I'm just feeling a bit down today, and they always cheer me up."
696,2,"Oh, I get it, sometimes you just need some space."
696,3,"Yeah, it can be tough when you're trying to focus."
696,4,"Oh, wow, that's gotta be rough."
696,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds really frustrating."
696,6,I know how frustrating that must be.
696,7,"Whoa, hey, maybe let's just take a breath first?"
697,0,That sounds really nice.
697,1,"Yeah, really."
697,2,I'd really like that.
697,3,I'm looking forward to it.
697,4,"Oh wow, that's...a lot."
697,5,"Oh, wow."
697,6,Incredible!
697,7,I can't believe it!
698,0,"I know, and I'm sorry."
698,1,hurting so much.
698,2,I don't know anymore.
698,3,Oh.
698,4,"I don't know, I'm so confused."
698,5,It sounds like you're really confused right now.
698,6,I'm just as confused as you are.
698,7,It sounds like you're really confused right now.
699,0,That's fantastic! I'm so happy for you!
699,1,That's fantastic! Congratulations!
699,2,I understand you're frustrated.
699,3,I understand you feel like you were cheated.
699,4,"Yes, it is."
699,5,I'm so sorry to hear that.
699,6,I can't believe that.
699,7,I can't believe she would do something like that.
699,8,I can't believe she would do something like that.
699,9,"I'm so sorry, I had no idea."
699,10,I'm not sure I can trust you right now.
699,11,I'm just trying to have a good time.
699,12,I understand this is incredibly upsetting.
699,13,"Please, I don't want to go."
699,14,It's going to be alright.
700,0,Hey there.
700,1,How are you doing?
700,2,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in right now."
700,3,I understand this is a lot to process right now.
700,4,I can't believe you're still pushing this.
700,5,I understand this is a difficult time.
700,6,I'm so sorry.
700,7,I understand it’s hard to accept.
700,8,I understand how hard this must be to hear.
700,9,"It's hard, isn't it?"
700,10,"I just, I don’t want to feel this way."
700,11,"Oh, Ross, I'm so sorry."
700,12,I really don't know.
701,0,We're just trying to figure things out.
701,1,That sounds like a lot of work!
702,0,That's wonderful to hear!
702,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
702,2,"It feels like a pretty hopeless situation, doesn't it?"
703,0,It's nice to hear you say that.
703,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been amazing."
703,2,"Oh, wow, that's quite a contrast."
703,3,"It's hard to believe sometimes, isn't it?"
703,4,I can imagine that must have been a lot to process.
703,5,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful."
703,6,That sounds incredibly unsettling.
704,0,"Be careful, please."
704,1,"I know you're excited, but please, just hear me out."
704,2,"I understand you're upset, but let's try to figure this out."
704,3,I can see how that would be frustrating.
704,4,"I know you're really excited, but I'm just not ready."
705,0,What's up?
705,1,"No, I'm really bummed."
705,2,That sounds really rewarding.
705,3,"That sounds like a lot of work, but also a really nice thing to do."
705,4,"That sounds exhausting, but also rewarding."
705,5,That sounds like a really rewarding way to spend the holidays.
705,6,It sounds like you're hoping to make a bigger impact this year.
705,7,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
705,8,That's quite a commitment.
706,0,I understand; it's okay.
706,1,I understand.
706,2,"I know, it can feel like a lifetime."
706,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was that long."
706,4,I understand.
706,5,"You're not feeling good about this, are you?"
706,6,Are you in pain?
706,7,"Yeah, it really is."
706,8,I'm so glad you're enjoying it.
706,9,I'm so glad you're enjoying it.
706,10,You sound so relieved.
707,0,What's wrong?
707,1,"Okay, okay, here it is."
707,2,"Oh, no!"
707,3,"Oh, wow, that's a bummer."
707,4,"Oh, that's disappointing."
707,5,"Ugh, I hate when that happens."
707,6,A penny!
707,7,"Ugh, that's disappointing."
707,8,I can see why you're surprised.
707,9,"I know, it's so frustrating when you find something unexpected."
707,10,I understand; you're worried about the bucket.
707,11,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry!"
707,12,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
707,13,"That's a little harsh, don't you think?"
707,14,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
707,15,"Oh, so you're saying I'm in trouble?"
708,0,I can see how that would be frustrating.
709,0,"Not today, man, I'm really not feeling up to it."
709,1,"That's awesome, good luck!"
710,0,That's great to hear!
711,0,I'm so glad to hear that!
712,0,That sounds like a lot of pressure to put on yourself.
712,1,I’m so glad you think so!
712,2,It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now.
712,3,"Yes, please, I'm really starting to panic."
712,4,"Okay, I'm ready when you are."
712,5,"Okay, so what do I do?"
712,6,I'm sorry you're feeling that way.
712,7,I'm so glad you're here for this!
712,8,I know it's a lot to take in all at once.
712,9,I guess so...
712,10,I'm so glad you like it!
712,11,I'm so nervous for this!
713,0,"I'm trying, but it's hard."
713,1,You poor thing.
713,2,I'm right here with you.
714,0,"Yes, I believe I do."
714,1,"Okay, take your time, I can wait."
714,2,"I'm so sorry, it sounds like you're in a real bind."
714,3,I understand you're feeling frustrated right now.
714,4,I understand your concern.
714,5,"Oh, that sounds incredibly frustrating and disrespectful."
715,0,I understand this must be frustrating.
716,0,That must be incredibly stressful.
716,1,That's okay; I understand it's not your responsibility.
716,2,I understand that must be frustrating.
716,3,I'm just trying to help.
716,4,It sounds like you feel very strongly about this.
716,5,I just want to help.
717,0,"Oh, that's a truly awful choice, I feel for you."
717,1,What? Really?
717,2,That’s amazing!
717,3,That's so cool!
717,4,"Oh, poor girl."
717,5,"I know, it's never easy to watch."
717,6,"I know, it's hard to watch."
717,7,"I know, it's hard to tell what's going on sometimes."
717,8,That's a tough one.
717,9,I'm feeling a little deflated now.
717,10,"Oh, that's so sweet!"
717,11,"Devastated, are you?"
717,12,"I'm sorry, I know you didn't mean for this to happen."
718,0,I understand.
718,1,"Yes, I do."
718,2,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry, I should have remembered."
718,3,"Yeah, I do."
718,4,That sounds like a pretty sweet deal.
718,5,"No, I moved out a few months ago."
718,6,That must be nice.
719,0,"Thanks, I'm really proud of it."
719,1,"Oh, that's a bummer."
719,2,It's always disappointing when something you like isn't yours.
719,3,That's awesome!
719,4,It really is.
719,5,"Oh, I love leather seats!"
719,6,I'm so glad you think so!
719,7,That's awesome!
720,0,I'm listening.
720,1,I just feel so lost right now.
720,2,I understand.
720,3,I understand this is frustrating.
720,4,I'd love to!
720,5,Alright!
720,6,"Alright, let's do it."
720,7,What's your question?
720,8,What's up?
720,9,"Oh, you're frustrated."
720,10,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was upsetting."
720,11,"Oh no, you seem really frustrated."
720,12,"I understand, it's a lot to handle."
720,13,Great!
720,14,I'm glad we can get this done.
720,15,What's wrong?
720,16,You sound really excited!
720,17,What's wrong?
720,18,"I get it, that feels good."
721,0,I understand that must be frustrating.
722,0,"It's okay, sometimes things just don't."
722,1,"It truly doesn't, does it?"
722,2,"I understand, it can be hard to explain those kinds of moments."
722,3,"I know, it sounds ridiculous when you say it out loud."
722,4,I understand how important it must have been to you.
722,5,"Oh, Chandler..."
722,6,That's... a lot to take in.
722,7,"I'm so sorry, Chandler."
722,8,What's this?
722,9,You're welcome.
722,10,"You were really worried about me, weren't you?"
722,11,It's the best thing I've ever tasted.
722,12,"You really love this sandwich, don't you?"
722,13,What?
722,14,I'm just trying to understand.
722,15,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
722,16,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
723,0,It's beautiful.
723,1,It's beautiful.
723,2,"Hi, yourself."
723,3,Hi!
723,4,Oh my gosh!
723,5,"Oh, wow, that's huge!"
723,6,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
723,7,"Oh, Pheebs."
724,0,Okay.
724,1,Sounds like a tough day.
724,2,It sounds like you're looking for something to feel good about.
724,3,I understand.
724,4,"That feels a bit much, doesn't it?"
724,5,I see your struggle to find the right name.
725,0,Hey! What's up?
725,1,How are you doing today?
725,2,I'm intrigued.
725,3,I'm a lot of things.
725,4,"Oh honey, that must sting."
725,5,"It hurts, doesn't it?"
725,6,That must be a nice feeling.
726,0,"No worries, it happens."
726,1,Thanks.
726,2,I can imagine that must have been uncomfortable.
726,3,"Yeah, that can be a little uncomfortable."
726,4,"Oh, I know the feeling."
726,5,That must be a fun skill to have.
726,6,That's a really thoughtful offer.
726,7,"Hey, no worries, I get it."
727,0,"Oh, wow, congratulations!"
727,1,"Oh wow, I'm so happy for you!"
727,2,I'm just messing with you; what job did you get?
727,3,"Oh, wow, that's a letdown."
727,4,"Oh, wow, I see how that could be confusing."
727,5,"Oh, I see, you're feeling a little frustrated right now."
727,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
727,7,"I'm just so excited, I can't even believe it!"
727,8,"That's fantastic, Joe!"
727,9,I know it's not exactly what you were hoping for.
728,0,"Oh wow, that sounds incredibly distressing."
728,1,That must have been incredibly distressing.
728,2,"Oh, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
728,3,That sounds incredibly painful.
728,4,That sounds incredibly awkward and uncomfortable.
728,5,That sounds incredibly stressful and confusing.
728,6,That sounds incredibly overwhelming.
728,7,"Oh wow, that must be so hard to deal with."
728,8,"Oh, wow, that must have been quite a shock."
728,9,This is a lot to take in.
728,10,That must have been incredibly awkward and uncomfortable.
728,11,That must have been so mortifying.
729,0,"Yeah, it's been a rough patch, to say the least."
729,1,How are you feeling about it?
730,0,It sounds like you've had a real breakthrough.
730,1,"That's a great idea, and it makes perfect sense now."
730,2,That would have made things so much easier.
730,3,It makes perfect sense now.
730,4,That sounds like a good plan.
730,5,That sounds like a wonderful idea.
730,6,Sounds like you're excited about this bookstore!
730,7,"Oh, that's a wonderful idea!"
730,8,That sounds like a lovely idea.
730,9,"I'm a little jealous, to be honest."
730,10,I can hear how excited you are for them.
730,11,It sounds like you're really excited for them.
730,12,It sounds like you're really excited for your friend.
730,13,I'm sure it's a lot to remember.
731,0,"Okay, I will remember that."
732,0,"Wow, that's a vast and fascinating expanse of history to consider."
732,1,You feel overwhelmed by all of that?
733,0,Hey!
733,1,"No, it didn't."
733,2,That must be a huge relief.
733,3,"Sure, I'd love to."
733,4,Great!
733,5,"Sure, I'm in."
733,6,"Oh, that's a shame, I was hoping you'd join us."
733,7,"Okay, sounds good."
733,8,"Sure, I’m listening."
733,9,I just saw Rachel.
733,10,"Oh, Ross..."
733,11,"I know, I'm so sorry, I should have told you sooner."
733,12,"Oh, Ross..."
734,0,"No, I'm not."
734,1,"Oh, you don't sound it."
734,2,"I’m so sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
735,0,"No, I didn't."
735,1,"Oh, I see."
735,2,It sounds like you're feeling a bit left out.
735,3,I can't believe you'd say that!
735,4,"Oh, I see."
735,5,"Yeah, she's great."
735,6,I understand.
735,7,"It’s a tough situation, isn't it?"
735,8,"I understand, it's a lot to handle."
735,9,"Thanks man, I appreciate that."
735,10,"I hear you, man, that stings."
735,11,I guess I just don't see it.
735,12,"I understand, it's tough when you feel like someone doesn't get you."
735,13,I can see this is really important to you.
735,14,I guess I can see how it looks that way.
735,15,I just… I don’t want to be like you.
735,16,I understand.
735,17,I can tell this is really confusing for you.
735,18,I can keep a secret.
735,19,Thank you.
736,0,Hey!
736,1,I missed you so much.
736,2,I didn't expect you to come.
736,3,I'm going to miss you so much.
736,4,"Oh, you're trying to cheer me up."
736,5,I’m going to miss you.
736,6,That's so thoughtful of you.
736,7,I'm all ears.
736,8,I'm all ears.
736,9,Tell me.
736,10,I'm ready.
736,11,"Oh, Emily..."
736,12,I'm so glad you said that.
736,13,I don’t know what to say.
737,0,Hey!
737,1,"Oh, I see."
737,2,Okay.
737,3,"Oh, that must have been a good nap then."
737,4,"Oh, I understand, insomnia is the worst."
737,5,"Yeah, I understand."
737,6,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
737,7,"I know, it’s so frustrating when your mind won’t quiet down."
737,8,That sounds like a safe and comforting place to be right now.
738,0,"Oh no, what did you see?"
738,1,I think I'm finally ready to start looking for a house.
738,2,Oh wow...
738,3,"Yeah, it really does."
738,4,"Oh, wow, that must bring up a lot of memories."
738,5,It's boarded up.
738,6,"Wow, that must be such a shock."
738,7,"I know, right? It’s a lot to take in."
738,8,It's like a piece of our history is just…gone.
739,0,I can see how that would feel disappointing.
739,1,I feel like I'm missing something.
739,2,I know it feels like a lot of pressure.
739,3,That sounds really exciting!
739,4,I am so excited for us!
739,5,...I understand.
739,6,I understand you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.
739,7,What is it?
739,10,"That's a pretty exciting thought, isn't it?"
739,11,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
739,12,"That's... unexpected, isn't it?"
739,13,That's so exciting!
739,14,That sounds like fun!
739,15,You sound a little disappointed.
739,16,"I'm sorry, I wasn't listening."
740,0,I know it's hard when you feel like you've disappointed someone.
740,1,"I know, it's a really tough situation."
740,2,I know this is really hard.
740,3,I can see how she might feel that way.
740,4,"Yeah, I can see how that would hurt."
740,5,I guess not.
740,6,It must have been so hard for her to feel like she was in second place.
740,7,"I know, it's hard to hear that."
740,8,I know it’s hard.
740,9,"Okay, I understand."
740,10,I know you want to make this right.
740,11,"Alright, let’s do this."
740,12,I'm ready if you are.
740,13,That’s…actually a really good idea.
741,0,"That sounds really nice, thanks."
741,1,"Yeah, I'd love to."
741,2,"Wow, that must have been amazing."
741,3,"Yep, it was a great boat."
741,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been so hard."
742,0,That must feel really wonderful!
743,0,It sounds like you're having a hard time.
743,1,It sounds like you're feeling relieved.
743,2,It sounds like you're feeling disappointed.
743,3,I understand that you want to keep it going.
743,4,"Oh, I understand."
743,5,I hear you.
744,0,...ever feel like that's all there is?
744,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot."
744,2,"Oh, I get it."
744,3,"Not tonight, thanks."
744,4,I'm really happy to hear that.
744,5,I'm really glad to hear that.
744,6,"Oh, that's a surprise, isn't it?"
744,7,Oh.
744,8,It's okay to be surprised.
744,9,I'm sorry.
744,10,"Hey, it's okay to feel overwhelmed right now."
744,11,Don't do that.
745,0,"That's a real bummer, isn't it?"
745,1,That sounds like a good way to forget about it all.
745,2,"That sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that."
745,3,"I'm sorry, did I upset you?"
745,4,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
745,5,"Nothing much, just feeling a bit lost, you know?"
745,6,I'm here for you.
745,7,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly stressful."
745,8,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
745,9,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
745,10,"Oh, man, that's a tough situation."
745,11,"I'm sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
746,0,"I know, it really stings when you get hurt."
747,0,"Yeah, I have."
747,1,"Yes, I was hoping you would say that."
747,2,"Oh wow, that must be a lot to process."
747,3,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
747,4,That must be a lot to process.
747,5,That must feel really weird.
747,6,"Oh honey, that must feel really confusing."
747,7,I'm sorry.
747,8,That's great!
747,9,That must feel so strange.
747,10,That must be a lot to process.
747,11,"It's just a lot to take in, isn't it?"
747,12,That sounds like it would be a lot to process.
747,13,I think you're just trying to figure things out.
747,14,"Oh, wow, that sounds frustrating."
747,15,I can understand why that would make you feel that way.
747,16,"Oh, honey, I get it."
747,17,That sounds so difficult.
747,18,"It's a lot, isn't it?"
748,0,That's wonderful to hear!
749,0,That sounds like a really fun thing to look forward to!
749,1,That sounds exciting!
749,2,You sound so excited!
749,3,You seem a little unsure.
749,4,"I'm feeling the pressure too, I can tell."
749,5,"Oh, that's exciting!"
749,6,You sound really excited!
749,7,"Wow, the stakes are so high!"
750,0,It sounds like you're really trying to see things from my perspective.
750,1,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
750,2,That's really kind of you to say.
750,3,Thank you.
750,4,That's good to hear.
751,0,"Yeah, it's a big step."
752,0,That must be hard.
752,1,"I understand, and I'm okay with that."
752,2,I just don't want to make you uncomfortable.
752,3,I’m glad.
752,4,"Hey, how are you doing?"
752,5,"Hey, it's good to see you!"
752,6,Of course!
752,7,I’m so glad to hear you say that.
752,8,"It's lovely to meet you, Ross."
752,9,Thank you.
752,10,It's really lovely.
752,11,"I'm a little nervous, too."
753,0,"Oh no, not him again?"
753,1,"Oh, you're feeling pretty proud right now, aren't you?"
753,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds...intense."
754,0,I understand how frustrating that must feel.
754,1,It's incredibly frustrating when time feels like it's working against you.
754,2,I understand your frustration.
754,3,It's frustrating when you feel like time is working against you.
754,4,"Oh, you're really feeling the pressure of time, aren't you?"
755,0,"Not as many as I'd hoped, I'm afraid."
755,1,I understand you're upset and don't want to talk to me.
755,2,"You still hurt her though, and that’s not okay."
755,3,I didn't mean to hurt her.
755,4,It means you're a really bad guy.
755,5,I just want you to know I'm not a bad person.
755,6,You’re making me really angry.
755,7,"Oh, here we go again."
755,8,It sounds like you're disappointed.
755,9,"You're trying to be the best, aren't you?"
756,0,"It was a disaster, honestly."
756,1,"Oh no, that doesn't sound good."
756,2,I'm so glad!
756,3,"Oh, wow, you must be really excited!"
756,4,"Oh, that's very sweet of you to say."
756,5,I understand.
756,6,"I know, it can be confusing."
756,7,"It sounds like you're trying to reassure yourself, too."
756,8,It's okay to have doubts.
756,9,Okay.
757,0,I'm not sure; I'm just really nervous.
757,1,"Oh, wow, I didn't realize you felt that way."
757,2,"Wow, that sounds like a lot to take in."
757,3,"I'm sorry if I upset you, it wasn't my intention."
757,4,I understand you're feeling a bit hurt right now.
757,5,I just don't want to lose you.
757,6,I'm listening.
757,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
757,8,I'm glad we're okay.
757,9,I won't.
757,10,I'm glad we're okay.
758,0,"Oh, that sounds incredibly painful."
758,1,I think I just stubbed my toe.
758,2,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
758,3,"Oh, no!"
758,4,"Oh my gosh, that sounds awful."
758,5,"Oh, wow, that sounds really painful."
759,0,I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
759,1,"Oh, I see."
759,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
759,3,"Oh, so you're feeling a bit awkward about it all?"
759,4,"I'm sorry, I know it sounds weird."
759,5,I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
759,6,"I, uh, don't want to talk about it."
759,7,"Oh, wow."
759,8,It's a surprise.
759,9,"Oh, wow."
759,10,"It's a friend, okay?"
759,11,I don't know what you mean.
759,12,I can see how this must be upsetting.
759,13,"Oh, honey."
759,14,I don't want to be either of them.
759,15,"I don't know, I'm just so confused right now."
760,0,"Thanks, I'm so glad you enjoyed it!"
760,1,"Oh, are you feeling a bit rushed?"
760,2,I can see that you're not feeling up to it.
760,3,"Oh, I understand."
760,4,I understand that must be disappointing.
761,0,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
761,1,"Hey, I didn't mean to hurt you."
761,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
761,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
761,4,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
761,5,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
761,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean for things to escalate like this."
761,7,Are you okay?
761,8,I can see you're both frustrated.
761,9,"Oh, that's a bit much, isn't it?"
762,0,"Oh, man, you must be furious right now."
762,1,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
762,2,I can't believe you did this!
762,3,I can see how uncomfortable you are.
762,4,I can see why you'd say that!
763,0,Hi there!
763,1,How are you feeling today?
763,2,"It's okay, I understand."
763,3,I understand; it sounds like you're feeling frustrated.
763,4,"Oh, that sounds really painful."
763,5,"It's alright, we all have things we're not proud of."
763,6,"Yeah, really."
763,7,"Oh, wow."
763,8,I’m glad.
763,9,That actually sounds really nice.
763,10,I'm so glad you think so!
764,0,Me too.
765,0,Thank you for understanding.
765,1,I know this can be a lot.
766,0,"It sounds like you're comfortable with it, even if it's not ideal."
766,1,I understand.
766,2,"Oh, it sounds like you're feeling a bit defensive right now."
766,3,It sounds like you're feeling really strong about that.
766,4,I'm just trying to understand.
766,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that."
766,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit self-critical right now.
767,0,"That's a really big feeling, and I get it."
767,1,"It's like a huge hurdle, isn't it?"
767,2,That must have been a really difficult time.
767,3,"It's okay, I get that."
767,4,It sounds like a really hard time.
767,5,"Oh, you're worried about what's coming next?"
767,6,That must feel like a big moment.
767,7,"Oh, wow, that must feel like a really big deal."
767,8,"Oh, you're feeling a bit overwhelmed?"
767,9,"That's a big moment, then."
767,10,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed.
767,11,"You seem excited, but also a little nervous."
768,0,I feel so lost and alone.
768,1,"Oh, that sounds really difficult."
768,2,"Oh, I see."
768,3,It's really frustrating when things don't go as planned.
768,4,It's frustrating when things don't go the way you expect.
768,5,"I am so sorry, that sounds awful."
768,6,"Oh, a hot date! That's exciting!"
768,7,"I'm sorry, that sounds stressful."
768,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
769,0,"I understand, it's hard when you long for that kind of companionship."
769,1,It's hard to want something so badly and not have it.
769,2,"I know, it's frustrating when you feel like you have no control."
770,0,I understand.
770,1,I hear your frustration.
770,2,"I know, it's infuriating."
770,3,It's good to know we're in this together.
770,4,It's like they're trying to pull a fast one on us.
770,5,I understand wanting everything to be perfect.
770,6,"Oh, I'm so excited to make it perfect for us."
770,7,I understand how frustrating that must be.
770,8,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
770,9,I didn't mean to upset you.
770,10,I didn't mean to upset you.
770,11,I can't believe this is happening.
770,12,"I'm so sorry, I really messed up."
770,13,I understand.
770,14,"I know, I'm sorry, I'm messing this up."
770,15,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little stressed out, too."
770,16,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
770,17,I'm sorry.
771,0,It sounds like you're finding some comfort in that thought.
771,1,"I know, it's bittersweet."
771,2,"Sure, I'll be here."
771,3,Alright.
771,4,"Sure, what's up?"
771,5,I understand.
771,6,"Oh, wow."
771,7,I understand.
771,8,That must feel really difficult to think about.
771,9,It's tough feeling like you're falling behind.
771,10,Anytime.
771,11,"It's alright, you'll be fine."
771,12,I get that that could be a little discouraging.
771,13,That’s gotta be frustrating.
771,14,That sounds like a scary thought.
771,15,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're really worried about this."
771,16,You okay?
771,17,"Yeah, it got me too, man."
772,0,"Thank you, Roman."
772,1,What do you want?
772,2,What do you want?
772,3,"Oh, Ramoray, you must be so angry right now."
772,4,"I know, right? It’s a huge relief."
772,5,"Thank heavens, she's alright!"
772,6,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
772,7,"Oh, Drake, that's wonderful news!"
772,8,I'm here for you.
772,9,I can't believe this is happening.
772,10,I'm so glad.
772,11,I love you.
772,12,"Oh, Joey!"
772,13,"Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry."
772,14,That's wonderful news!
772,15,"Oh, you're so kind."
773,0,"Oh, that's a relief."
773,1,"Hey, it's okay, sometimes it's hard to think about where our food comes from."
773,2,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process right now."
774,0,"I know it's hard, but I'm trying."
774,1,I understand your concern.
774,2,"I know it's scary, but I can't help it."
774,3,I know you're just looking out for me.
774,4,"Oh, honey, I just want you to be safe."
774,5,I just wanted to see if you're okay.
774,6,"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know a Phoebe."
774,7,"Oh, okay, well, thanks anyway."
774,8,"Oh, that must be difficult."
774,9,"Oh wow, that must be a shock."
774,10,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
775,0,What's on your mind?
775,1,"Oh wow, that sounds like a story."
775,2,"Yeah, that sounds pretty memorable."
775,3,"Oh, wow, that must have been shocking."
775,4,"Oh wow, that's quite a story."
775,5,I'm dying to know!
775,6,"That sounds like a story, alright."
775,7,"Oh, wow, Milwaukee!"
775,8,"Wow, that sounds like a story."
775,9,"Oh, wow, that's a bold choice."
775,10,That sounds like a wild memory!
775,11,That sounds incredibly frustrating!
775,12,That sounds like a really uncomfortable situation.
775,13,That must have been mortifying.
776,0,Hey there.
776,1,How are you doing?
776,2,"Yes, it is."
776,3,I'm so sorry I missed it!
776,4,"Oh no, I'm sorry you missed the play."
776,5,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
776,6,"That's good, but I bet it still felt like forever."
776,7,That was really thoughtful of you.
777,0,It sounds like you're feeling a bit nostalgic.
777,1,"Oh, you really admire her talent."
777,2,"I’m just saying, I’m really proud of her."
777,3,You're really thinking about redecorating?
777,4,I can tell you’re a little hurt.
777,5,"Oh, Ross, you know how much I love your style."
777,6,"I know, it’s hard to let go of things."
777,7,I can't believe it!
777,8,"Oh, Ross, that sounds like a lot."
777,9,"Oh, I see."
777,10,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry."
777,11,I'd love to go!
777,12,"Oh, wow."
777,13,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I sound like I was making fun of you?"
778,0,"Oh, thank you, that's really kind of you to say."
778,1,"They're lovely, truly."
778,2,"Of course, I'd be glad to help."
778,3,"Yes, anything to help with that pain."
778,4,"Okay, I'm coming over now."
778,5,That sounds really painful.
778,6,"It’s been a long journey, hasn’t it?"
778,7,That sounds really uncomfortable.
778,8,That sounds exhausting.
778,9,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
778,10,"Well, something certainly got you."
779,0,That must be incredibly difficult.
779,1,I'm so sorry.
780,0,"I understand, it sounds like you're really frustrated right now."
780,1,"It's tough, isn't it?"
780,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
780,3,That must feel really unsettling.
780,4,"I know, I'm sorry."
780,5,I just want to know why.
780,6,"I understand, it must be difficult."
780,7,I understand this is important to you.
781,0,That sounds like a really special place for you.
781,1,It must feel good to have a place to share your music.
782,0,Thank you so much!
782,1,You're welcome.
782,2,Hi!
782,3,Sounds like fun!
782,4,"Oh no, what is it?"
782,5,I'm listening.
782,6,Oh wow.
782,7,"Oh, wow."
782,8,Wow.
782,9,Wow.
782,10,Wow.
782,11,"Oh no, are you okay?"
783,0,Hello there.
783,1,"Hi Phoebe, it's nice to meet you too."
783,2,"Oh, wow, that's…a lot to take in."
783,3,"Oh, wow, so this is really happening for you."
783,4,"Oh, that's a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
783,5,"Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
783,6,"Oh honey, that sounds so intense."
783,7,I'm ready.
783,8,I'm here for you.
784,0,That must feel like a lot to process all at once.
784,1,... worried about what time will do to me.
785,0,I understand that must be difficult.
785,1,I understand this must be incredibly painful.
786,0,"I'm so sorry, I know this must be incredibly frustrating."
786,1,I understand this feels really uncomfortable right now.
786,2,"I understand, it's upsetting when things don't go as you expect."
786,3,It's incredibly upsetting when things don't go as you expect.
787,0,"Thanks, man, I really appreciate that."
787,1,"Oh, I see, you're feeling a little sensitive about grammar right now."
787,2,"That sounds really nice, thanks."
787,3,"Hey, what's up?"
787,4,"Yeah, I'm just not feeling so great right now."
787,5,"Okay, I'm listening."
787,6,I feel so exposed right now.
787,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
787,8,I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
787,9,I understand this must be really difficult for you.
787,10,"I know, it's complicated."
788,0,I can hear the nerves in your voice.
788,1,I'm so nervous right now.
788,2,"Oh, that sounds… disappointing."
788,3,"Oh, that sounds really frustrating."
788,4,It sounds like you could use some rest.
789,0,"I just felt so awkward, though."
789,1,I'm glad you had a good time and could laugh.
789,2,"Aw, that's really nice of you to say."
789,3,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
789,4,I'm nervous too.
789,5,"Oh, wow."
789,6,Oh.
789,7,Okay.
789,8,"Oh, wow, that sounds really uncomfortable."
789,9,"No, I'm not, I'm just saying..."
790,0,"It's alright, no worries."
791,0,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
791,1,That must be incredibly disappointing.
791,2,I just feel like I'm always falling short.
791,3,That sounds really disappointing.
791,4,"That's great news, I'm so happy for you!"
791,5,"Thanks, I'm glad you're happy for me."
791,6,You're welcome!
791,7,"Wow, that sounds really exciting!"
791,8,"I know, it's frustrating when you're not feeling it."
791,9,I hear you.
791,10,It sounds like you're really longing for that kind of experience.
791,11,"I know, it's tough when you have to put those things on hold."
791,12,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
791,13,What's up?
791,14,"I'm sure you'll be able to do all of that again, someday."
791,15,That's really nice of you to offer.
791,16,I just want you to have some fun.
791,17,"Aw, that's so sweet."
791,18,That sounds… incredibly stressful.
791,19,I’m so glad!
791,20,I’m really looking forward to it!
791,21,"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this."
792,0,Hey there.
792,1,How are you doing?
792,2,About what?
792,3,It sounds like you're really feeling unsure about something.
792,4,It sounds like you're really excited about your work!
792,5,"That sounds like fun, actually."
792,6,"It's okay, I understand the feeling of not being able to act."
792,7,"That's a great idea, but I understand if you'd rather focus on your own work."
792,8,It sounds like this role really means a lot to you.
792,9,"I'm really sorry, Joey."
792,10,Sounds like you're really excited about this role.
792,11,"I know, it's tough when you feel like you're missing out."
792,12,That sounds like a really difficult situation.
792,13,"I know, it's so frustrating, isn't it?"
792,14,"Oh, I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
792,15,I know this is hard.
792,16,I understand how painful that must be.
792,17,I understand how agonizing this must be.
792,18,I understand how agonizing that must feel.
792,19,I can't.
792,20,"Please, just this once."
793,0,I just feel so alone right now.
793,1,"Oh, you really wanted the bigger half, huh?"
793,2,I can't believe you're doing this.
793,3,What are you toasting to?
793,4,That sounds like a win in my book.
793,5,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit grateful for how things turned out, even with the unexpected twists."
793,6,"Oh, wow."
793,7,I'm glad you feel that way.
793,8,"You really do care, don't you?"
793,9,"You're right, it is kind of nice to have each other."
793,10,I'm glad we have each other.
794,0,What's wrong?
794,1,I'm listening.
794,2,I understand how much this means to you.
794,3,It must be so hard to feel this way right now.
794,4,I understand how much this means to you.
794,5,I understand how much this means to you.
794,6,I can hear the desperation in your voice.
794,7,I promise.
794,8,I can tell you're really hurting.
794,9,I will.
794,10,I understand.
795,0,"I'm so sorry, I can see you're really upset."
795,1,"It’s okay, we'll figure this out together."
795,2,I understand that must be frustrating.
795,3,I understand.
795,4,"Okay, I understand."
795,5,"Okay, bye."
795,6,"Okay, I understand."
795,7,Bye.
795,8,"Okay, I get it."
796,0,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
796,1,I know this is probably disappointing to hear.
796,2,"Oh no, I'm suddenly very worried."
796,3,"Oh, wow."
796,4,"Oh honey, I am so sorry."
796,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds so stressful."
796,6,"Yeah, I can see how that would feel."
796,7,"Okay, I get that."
796,8,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
796,9,"Oh, wow, that's got to be tough."
796,10,"Oh, wow, that's got to be a tough situation."
796,11,"Oh no, that sounds like a real problem."
796,12,"Oh, honey, I’m so sorry; that sounds terrible."
796,13,I can't believe you feel that way.
796,14,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
796,15,"Okay, Chandler, I can see you're really upset."
796,16,"Oh, honey."
796,17,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
796,18,I just feel like I keep messing things up.
796,19,"Oh, honey, I hear you."
796,20,I’m going to miss you.
797,0,Hi there.
797,1,How are you doing?
797,2,"Not so great, honestly."
797,3,I'm glad you're feeling okay.
797,4,"Oh, wow..."
797,5,"Oh, wow."
797,6,"Oh, wow."
797,7,You're welcome.
797,8,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
797,9,"I know, but still..."
797,10,I'm so sorry you're going through this.
797,11,I'm going to miss you too.
797,12,I'm really going to miss that.
797,13,...the theatre?
798,0,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
798,1,I just feel so foolish right now.
798,2,It sounds like something is really upsetting you.
798,3,"I know, it's awful, isn't it?"
798,4,"I know, it's the worst feeling."
798,5,I know.
798,6,I can't believe this is happening.
799,0,I know how discouraging that must feel.
799,1,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you're really nervous."
799,2,"Oh, I completely understand; it's hard when you're nervous about something like that."
799,3,I can see how this is making him anxious.
799,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds really tough."
799,5,I understand this is really difficult for him.
799,6,I understand this is difficult.
800,0,I understand.
800,1,Okay.
801,0,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry to hear that."
801,1,I'm really scared.
801,2,I'm here for you.
801,3,I'm really scared.
801,4,"Yes, squeeze as hard as you need to."
801,5,It's going to be alright.
801,6,"I'm right here with you, buddy."
801,7,"I know it's hard, but you're doing great."
801,8,"I know it hurts, sweetheart."
802,0,"Oh my gosh, that's amazing!"
802,1,I have my ways.
802,2,"Oh no, what’s wrong?"
802,3,"Front row, center!"
802,4,Oh.
803,0,I'm sorry you feel that way.
803,1,I just want you to be nice to me.
803,2,I just want to make things right.
803,3,I'm here for you.
803,4,Thank you for saying that.
803,5,I feel the same way about you.
803,6,I understand.
804,0,"Hello there, how are you doing today?"
804,1,Just admiring the view.
804,2,"It's alright, you don't need to apologize."
804,3,"Oh no, I am so sorry, I didn't realize."
804,4,"I understand, it's easy to forget."
804,5,I just didn't realize.
804,6,: You really think that’s what I’m like?
804,7,I really didn't mean to cause you more work.
804,8,I understand you're feeling frustrated.
804,9,"It's alright, I know things can get frustrating."
805,0,Hi there!
805,1,This is a conversation.
805,2,"Oh, that must be exciting!"
805,3,"Wow, that must feel amazing!"
805,4,You seem really excited!
805,5,That must have been a heart-stopping moment!
805,6,"Oh man, that would be so frustrating!"
805,7,"It's alright, I understand the frustration."
806,0,That must be so frustrating!
806,1,"No, I didn't!"
806,2,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up about this.
806,3,I am so sorry!
806,4,"Oh no, what did you do?"
806,5,"You’re feeling really bad about this, aren't you?"
806,6,"Oh no, what happened?"
806,7,I'm so sorry; I can only imagine how bad you feel right now.
806,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a lot to deal with all at once."
806,9,I'm so glad you're happy.
806,10,I'm so sorry.
806,11,I just don't know how to do it.
806,12,I understand.
806,13,Thank you.
806,14,Absolutely not.
806,15,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
806,16,"I know, I feel it too, Rach."
806,17,"Oh my god, yes!"
807,0,You're welcome.
807,1,I understand your frustration.
808,0,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
808,1,"I know, it's just hard to let it go."
808,2,It sounds like you’re really feeling the pressure right now.
808,3,I just don’t know what to think anymore.
808,4,"Oh, you really want this to be perfect, don't you?"
808,5,I just feel so…betrayed.
808,6,"That sounds like a lot of pent-up emotion, Monica."
808,7,I love you too!
809,0,That's wonderful!
809,1,That must feel great!
809,2,That's right!
809,3,"Oh, man, that stings!"
809,4,"I'm sorry, I know that stings."
809,5,"Oh no, that’s a huge bill to face."
809,6,"Oh, that's a tough loss, I understand."
809,7,"Oh, wow, that's tough."
809,8,"Whoa, that's a lot of pressure, but I'm ready if you are."
809,9,I know you're feeling the pressure.
809,10,I'm a little nervous now.
809,11,"Alright, let's do this!"
809,12,"Alright, let's do this!"
809,13,I am ready!
809,14,I can feel the desperation!
809,15,I understand your frustration.
810,0,"I don't know, but they look lost."
810,1,"Oh, you sound scared."
810,2,"Oh, you are?"
810,3,"Oh, you are?"
810,4,"It's okay, I understand."
810,5,"I can't see anything, but I'm scared."
810,6,"Oh, hello there!"
810,7,I don't know.
810,8,"That sounds amazing, I'd love to try some!"
810,9,"They do sound pretty good, don't they?"
810,10,That's so early!
810,11,"Sure, come and get it!"
810,12,"Oh, I understand, that must be frustrating."
810,13,"Okay, I understand."
810,14,I do.
810,15,I'm so glad to hear that.
810,16,"I guess I'm not very memorable, then."
810,17,Night!
811,0,I understand you're worried about the situation.
811,1,"I understand this is frustrating, but we have to follow protocol."
811,2,I can see how frustrating this is.
811,3,"Oh, thank God, I can't believe it's over."
811,4,I'm so relieved for you.
811,5,"That means a lot, thanks."
811,6,"I appreciate that, Joey."
811,7,That's a relief.
811,8,I'm glad I could help.
811,9,"Thank you, Aaron."
811,10,"I'm so sorry, man."
812,0,It's understandable that you're feeling unsure.
812,1,I'm so glad we're on the same page.
812,2,"Oh, I see what you mean."
812,3,I'm so confused.
812,4,Hey? What's wrong?
812,5,I'm so glad to hear from you!
812,8,You make me feel so happy.
812,9,Oh really?
812,10,Here you go!
812,11,I'm so excited for you!
812,12,He certainly does.
812,13,I'm so happy you like them!
812,14,"You're very welcome, I am happy to help!"
812,15,I'm so happy you like them.
813,0,It's okay to feel disappointed when something you enjoy isn't quite what you expected.
813,1,It's okay to feel disappointed.
813,2,That looks like it really upset you.
813,3,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
813,4,That sounds really frustrating.
813,5,"No, I didn't."
813,6,That must have been frustrating.
813,7,"I'm sorry, I don't think I know who that is."
813,8,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't work out like you hope."
813,9,I'm so sorry.
813,10,"Oh, you seem really upset."
814,0,"I'm feeling a little nervous, but I'm ready."
814,1,I know it feels like a lot right now.
814,2,I understand this is a lot to handle.
814,3,"I know this is tough, but we can do it."
814,4,"I'm trying, but this is really heavy."
815,0,I'm so nervous right now.
815,1,"Another disaster, I know."
815,2,Fail.
815,3,Because you're nervous?
816,0,But it still hurts to think about that.
816,1,"It's just so hard to accept, isn't it?"
816,2,"Please don't go, I'm here."
816,3,"Thank you, I will always remember you."
816,4,"I will, Monica."
817,0,That's amazing!
817,1,I'm so excited for you!
817,2,"Oh, wow, that must have been a shock."
817,3,I'm so sorry; that must have been jarring.
817,4,"Oh, that must have been so confusing!"
817,5,I bet you're feeling really confused right now.
817,6,"That would be a little strange, wouldn't it?"
817,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
817,8,I can see that this is really bothering you.
817,9,That sounds like it really hurt.
817,10,I understand how much this means to you.
817,11,I'm so happy for you!
817,12,I can help you find her.
817,13,I hope you find her.
817,14,I'm glad things are looking up for you.
818,0,It's completely understandable to feel protective right now.
818,1,I understand how frustrating that would be.
818,2,It sounds like you're feeling protective and a little wary.
818,3,"It's like they're circling, waiting for an opening."
818,4,It sounds like you've been through some tough experiences.
818,5,"I know, it's hard to feel like you're being judged."
818,6,That must be so frustrating.
818,7,I guess I'm just worried about being judged.
819,0,"Hey, what's wrong?"
819,1,Bye.
819,2,"Oh, are you alright?"
819,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you worry."
819,4,"Oh, come on, you can tell me."
819,5,I understand that secrets can be hurtful.
819,6,"I understand, but it still makes me a little sad."
819,7,"I know, I know."
819,8,"Oh, that's a low blow, I see."
819,9,"I understand, but I’m still curious."
819,10,You got me there.
819,11,"Oh, wow, you really want to know what Phoebe said."
819,12,"I'm a little nervous now, too."
819,13,"Oh, wow, this is exciting!"
819,14,"I know, it's so embarrassing."
819,15,I can't believe I'm about to tell you.
819,16,"Oh, wow, that's too bad."
819,17,I'm sorry you feel that way.
819,18,"I'm so sorry, honey."
820,0,"It was awful, I completely blanked!"
820,1,"Oh, no, I must have the wrong person."
820,2,I'm just trying to figure things out right now.
820,3,"Wow, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
820,4,"No, I didn't get it."
820,5,"That's fantastic, I'm so happy for you!"
820,6,"It was for a commercial, but the casting director said I had a great look."
820,7,"Wow, that sounds like an amazing opportunity!"
820,8,"Yeah, it sounds like it could be a really great role."
820,9,"Wow, that sounds like a huge opportunity!"
820,10,"I know, it's kind of a lot to take in."
820,11,That's a lot of pressure!
820,12,Exactly!
820,13,"Wow, that's a lot of pressure!"
820,14,That's fantastic!
820,15,That's amazing!
820,16,That must be so frustrating.
820,17,I just don’t know what to do.
820,18,"Wow, that's a lot to process."
820,19,That's a huge decision.
820,20,That must be so nerve-wracking.
820,21,This is incredible!
821,0,I can imagine that must have felt really disheartening.
821,1,That doesn't mean you noticed *me*.
821,2,"You know, the guy who always looked like he was about to fall asleep?"
821,3,Oh.
821,4,"I'm so sorry, I can see how that would be hurtful."
821,5,"I did, but I don't want to hurt your feelings."
821,6,Oh.
821,7,I just don't want to say it.
821,8,"Aww, that's really sweet."
821,9,I'm glad you think so.
821,10,I'm really glad to hear that.
821,11,I'm so glad to hear that!
821,12,That's such a relief to hear.
821,13,"Oh, wow, that's a bit jarring, isn't it?"
821,14,It’s just Burt.
822,0,That sounds incredibly disheartening.
822,1,"Well, that sounds like it could be a lot to handle."
822,2,"Oh no, I'm sorry, what happened?"
822,3,"I'm so sorry, I know you were really hoping for that one."
822,4,"Ouch, that's a tough one."
822,5,"Ouch, that's a tough one."
822,6,"Oh, wow, that's harsh."
822,7,I know this is a lot to take in.
822,8,"Oh, wow."
823,0,Hey.
823,1,"Not great, honestly."
823,2,That sounds exciting!
823,3,"I don't know, I'm just so confused right now."
823,4,That must be a relief.
823,5,"I know this is hard, but you deserve to be happy."
823,6,"Oh, honey."
823,7,I just don't want you to get hurt.
823,8,"I don't know, but it sounds like you're really hoping he isn't."
823,9,I just don't want to believe it.
823,10,Just get away from him.
823,11,Okay.
823,12,"Of course, sweetie."
823,13,"Oh, Monica."
823,14,"I'm sorry, that's a tough spot to be in."
824,0,That's so exciting!
824,1,"Oh wow, really?"
825,0,"No, she's not."
825,1,It must be so hard to know what to believe.
825,2,"I'm okay, just a little shaken up, I guess."
826,0,Hey!
826,1,You must be so proud.
826,2,I'm so nervous to hear!
826,3,"Oh, that's disappointing to hear."
826,4,"Oh, you weren't?"
827,0,That sounds like a profound and powerful connection.
827,1,"I do, I really do."
827,2,"Oh, that was really thoughtful of you."
827,3,You're very welcome.
827,4,"I'm not sure, but I'm a little worried about what it might be."
827,5,"I won't, I promise."
827,6,I'm here to listen.
827,7,It sounds like you're feeling a little sheepish about this.
827,8,It sounds like you were really drawn in.
827,11,"It's a very tempting thought, isn't it?"
827,12,It's exciting to think about something like that!
827,13,"It's a scary thought, isn't it?"
827,14,"It sounds so tempting, doesn't it?"
827,15,"It's so tempting, isn't it?"
828,0,"Okay, I see you."
828,1,"Well, I'm in a hurry."
828,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you needed it."
828,3,"Look, I don't care."
828,4,"I understand, it's frustrating when you're in the middle of something."
828,5,I just want to wash my clothes.
828,6,I can see you're frustrated.
828,7,It sounds like you're frustrated.
828,8,"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry that happened to you."
828,9,No.
828,10,"Oh, wow, that's so frustrating."
828,11,"I know, it's frustrating when you're in the middle of something."
828,12,It's really frustrating when someone disregards your efforts like that.
828,13,"I understand, it's frustrating when someone takes your machine."
828,14,I understand it's frustrating when someone takes your machine.
828,15,I can see you're really upset.
829,0,I understand your frustration; it's a tough situation to be in.
829,1,I understand how frustrating that can be.
829,2,I can hear your frustration.
830,0,That sounds like fun!
830,1,I'm so glad you're here.
830,2,"I'm so sorry, are you alright?"
830,3,"Oh, I am so sorry!"
830,4,"Oh, you think so?"
830,5,"Oh, are you having some fun?"
830,6,"Oh, are you feeling a bit down?"
830,7,"Oh, that sounds really frustrating."
831,0,That must feel incredibly liberating.
831,1,"That's an incredible feeling, isn't it?"
831,2,"That's wonderful, and you deserve to feel that way."
831,3,I'm right there with you.
831,4,"It's a really amazing feeling, isn't it?"
831,5,"I know, I'm sorry, I haven't been the best."
831,6,It sounds like you're really feeling lost right now.
831,7,"I know, it's just so frustrating."
832,0,Hey there! What's up?
832,1,"No, you didn't miss anything."
832,2,"Oh no, what happened?"
832,3,I'm so proud of you!
832,4,"I'm so sorry, I lost track of time."
832,5,That sounds really exciting!
832,6,"It was kind of a whirlwind, wasn't it?"
832,7,"It doesn't matter, I'm just glad you're back."
832,8,"It was pretty random, actually."
832,9,That sounds like it was a very strategic move.
832,10,That must have been a pretty exciting encounter.
832,11,I was just hoping you were having a good time.
832,12,"Oh, that must be disappointing."
832,13,That must be so frustrating.
832,14,"Oh, that's a tough situation."
832,15,I can tell you're feeling pretty proud of yourself right now.
833,0,"It's alright, I understand your frustration."
833,1,"It's just not an option, I understand."
833,2,That must be very upsetting.
833,3,I understand how upsetting that is.
833,4,It sounds like you're really worried about the music.
833,5,I can't believe this is happening.
833,6,"Oh, I understand how frustrating that must be."
834,0,"Oh, that does look scary."
834,1,I can see how that would make you wonder.
834,2,It's like you're really seeing something in them.
834,3,That must be very upsetting for her.
834,4,That must feel incredibly frustrating for her.
834,5,It sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.
834,6,That sounds like a pretty vulnerable moment.
834,7,I bet you would.
834,8,That sounds like a perfect date to me.
834,9,"Yeah, it's always good to be prepared."
834,10,"That's a tough one, I can see why you'd ask."
834,11,"That's a tough one, isn't it?"
834,12,"It's a tough call, isn't it?"
834,13,"Oh, that's disappointing."
834,14,"I’m sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
834,15,I guess we're not each other's type.
835,0,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
835,1,"Oh, wow, that must have been a really difficult decision."
835,2,I just can't believe you'd think that.
835,3,That must have been a difficult choice.
835,4,I just didn’t want to deal with the fallout.
835,5,I can see how much this means to you.
835,6,It’s just that I don’t think she’ll believe me.
835,7,"I'm here for you, man."
835,8,I can see how frustrating this is for you.
835,9,I'm just worried about you.
835,10,I can't believe you're still doing this.
835,11,"Oh, honey, no, don't say that."
836,0,I can see why you'd be curious about that.
836,1,"Oh, okay, I get it."
836,2,"Yeah, I can see how you'd think that."
836,3,"Wow, that's actually pretty cool."
836,4,It's almost time for me to go.
836,5,I'm starving.
836,6,That's amazing; I'm impressed!
836,7,"Yeah, I'm actually kinda impressed!"
836,8,That's amazing!
836,9,"Oh man, I'm starving!"
836,10,It's amazing how focused we were.
836,11,I'm starving!
836,12,What's up?
837,0,It's me.
837,1,"Oh, Phoebe, I'm so glad to hear from you!"
837,2,Hey! I was hoping you'd be here.
838,0,I know this must be incredibly shocking to hear.
839,0,I understand; it must be difficult.
839,1,I just don't feel like it.
839,2,"And it's hard, isn't it?"
839,3,I just feel so… lost.
839,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
839,5,I can see this is frustrating.
839,6,I'm guessing that caught you off guard.
839,7,"Oh, I see, you're feeling really frustrated."
839,8,It sounds like you're really upset.
839,11,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
839,12,I can see you're really upset.
839,13,I'm sorry you feel that way.
839,14,I'm sorry you feel that way.
839,15,I can't believe you'd say that.
840,0,Hey there!
840,1,I'm feeling a bit down today.
840,2,"Yes, I am."
840,3,"Oh, that must be sad."
840,4,"Oh honey, what's wrong?"
840,5,Okay.
840,6,"What's wrong, Rach?"
840,7,I can see you're a little flustered.
840,8,You seem really nervous.
840,9,"Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet."
840,10,"I know, right?"
840,11,You're so sweet.
840,12,"Aww, thanks, Rach."
840,13,I'm glad you like them!
840,14,What's going on?
840,15,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
841,0,I just can't help it.
841,1,"Okay, I understand."
841,2,"I don't know, but you sound upset."
841,3,"Oh, so you're used to this kind of thing?"
841,4,"Oh, sweetie, that sounds like a really stressful experience."
841,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit caught off guard.
841,6,"Oh, wow, so you're really feeling caught off guard by this."
841,7,"Oh, I know they can get a little carried away sometimes."
841,8,"Oh, honey, that must have been so overwhelming."
841,9,"Oh, wow."
841,10,I understand that this is a lot to take in.
841,11,I know this must be upsetting.
841,12,Okay.
841,13,I understand.
841,14,I understand.
841,15,"I understand, and I'm here for you."
841,16,"I was worried about you, too."
841,17,I think so.
841,18,I'm so glad.
841,19,"Yeah, it was gorgeous, right?"
841,20,I’m glad you thought so.
841,21,I'm so nervous right now.
841,22,I’m just so happy.
842,0,I'm listening.
842,1,That sounds like a really stressful thing to figure out.
842,2,That sounds like a really difficult situation.
842,3,"Oh, wow."
842,4,I am so incredibly sorry.
842,5,I am so sorry to hear that.
842,6,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up about this.
842,7,It sounds like you're really struggling.
842,10,"Oh wow, that's a pretty big deal."
842,11,I understand that you're feeling frustrated.
842,12,"Oh, wow, that's gotta sting."
843,0,"I'm really sorry, that sounds incredibly stressful."
843,1,"That's really tough, I'm so sorry."
843,2,That must be so frustrating for you right now.
843,3,That sounds like a lot of stress.
843,4,"It was just so awkward, wasn't it?"
843,5,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
843,6,I was so looking forward to the reception!
843,7,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
843,8,"I know, it’s just so frustrating."
843,9,I hear how devastating this feels right now.
843,10,"It's awful, I know."
843,11,"I know, it’s a lot to process right now."
843,12,"I know, it's just not what you envisioned."
843,13,"I know, it's just… disappointing."
843,14,I just don’t know if I can do that.
844,0,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
844,1,"Oh, I understand, sometimes it's good to be in the center."
844,2,"Oh, I see, you're hoping for some company today."
844,3,"That’s very kind of you, Joey."
844,4,I know what you mean; it can feel a little strange sometimes.
844,5,"It's like we're all islands, aren't we?"
844,6,"It does feel like there's a chasm, doesn't it?"
844,7,"I couldn't agree more, it's time for a change."
844,8,I'm Joey.
844,9,I'm Rachel.
844,10,It sounds like you're all feeling a bit disconnected right now.
844,11,It's okay to feel scared; this city can be overwhelming.
844,12,"It's okay to feel that way, Ted; it's a big city."
844,13,"I think we can all relate to that feeling, Ted."
844,14,"Well, Andrew, you're not alone in that feeling."
844,15,I'm Ross!
844,16,"Oh, honey, I hear you."
844,17,And I'm really sorry to hear that.
844,18,"It's nice to meet you, Scott."
844,19,"I'm Barry, and I'm just happy to be here."
844,20,"Oh, Scott, that must be so difficult."
845,0,"No problem, I'm happy to see you."
845,1,I'm glad you're excited to get started!
845,2,I'm glad you're feeling that way.
845,3,I'm excited to see what we can do together!
845,4,I know we can do this together.
845,5,"Oh, you want to celebrate already?"
845,6,You can call me Ace.
845,7,"It's alright, Bing; everyone makes mistakes."
845,8,I'm glad you thought so.
845,9,"Well, I'm glad we can share a laugh."
845,10,It sounds like you're really trying to build a good atmosphere.
845,11,I'm glad to be here.
846,0,I'm worried about that.
846,1,I can only imagine how surprised you must have been.
846,2,"Oh wow, that must be a surprise."
846,3,I can see how that might feel a bit unusual.
846,4,"Ouch, that must have stung."
847,0,"I know, right?"
847,1,I can tell you're feeling flustered.
847,2,I'm going to miss you too.
847,3,"I know, it's hard to say goodbye."
847,4,"I know, it's kind of silly, isn't it?"
847,5,"I know, it's hard to let go."
848,0,"Rachel? Wow, hey."
848,1,"Oh, Rachel, that sounds tough."
848,2,"Oh, Rach, I didn't mean to make things worse."
848,3,What is it?
848,4,"I am so sorry, Rachel."
848,5,I wouldn't say that.
848,6,"I'm so sorry, Rachel."
848,7,I... I'm so sorry.
848,8,I can't believe this is happening.
848,9,"I'm so sorry, Ross."
848,10,"Oh, Rach."
848,11,"I'm so sorry, Rachel."
849,0,That's fantastic news!
849,1,I'm so excited for you!
849,2,"Oh wow, that must be such a relief!"
849,3,"Oh, wow, that must have been so nerve-wracking!"
849,4,"Wow, that must feel pretty intimidating."
849,5,"You're feeling confident about this, aren't you?"
849,6,I bet you're feeling pretty confident right now!
849,7,"You're right, you're totally ready for this."
849,8,That would be amazing!
849,9,"Yeah, I guess that's a little disappointing."
849,10,"Ouch, that stings a little, doesn't it?"
849,11,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
850,0,I'm so glad you think so.
850,1,"I understand, that's frustrating."
850,2,That sounds incredibly stressful.
850,3,"Oh no, that's terrible timing."
850,4,"I'm so sorry, that's awful timing."
850,5,"Yes, I do."
850,6,I'm so ready!
851,0,"That sounds really tough, I'm sorry to hear that."
851,1,"No, a friend."
851,2,"Oh, that's tough."
851,3,"Oh, I see."
851,4,"It must be hard, having to navigate this alone."
851,5,Kristen.
851,6,"It's nice to finally meet you, Kristen."
851,7,"So, what are you working on right now?"
851,8,"Yeah, just a few blocks over."
851,9,That's cool.
851,10,That's great!
851,11,"Oh, nice!"
851,12,Okay.
851,13,"Oh no, that's awful!"
851,14,That's a pretty rough way to start your day.
851,15,"Wow, that's really forward, but also kind of sweet."
851,16,"Oh, that's too bad."
851,17,"I'm really sorry, but I can't."
851,18,"Okay, just around the corner."
851,19,I can manage.
851,20,"Great, thanks!"
852,0,Hey.
852,1,What's on your mind?
852,2,I know this is hard.
852,3,I understand; it's okay.
852,4,It sounds like you were really caught up in the moment.
852,5,I understand that must be hard to hear.
852,6,I understand this is hard to hear.
852,7,That must be really hard.
852,8,"I know, and that's not fair to you."
853,0,"Oh, that must be a lot to handle."
853,1,I'm sorry if that makes you feel like I'm not there for you.
853,2,I understand you feel bad about that.
853,3,I understand you're still really upset.
853,4,I'm still really shaken up.
853,5,"That's awful, I'm so sorry to hear that."
853,6,I understand that you are upset.
853,7,"I’m so sorry, that really sucks."
853,8,I can't believe this is happening right now.
853,9,I understand you're frustrated.
853,10,Because I need to get back home.
853,11,I hear you.
853,12,I'm just really disappointed.
853,13,"I just want to see you happy, too."
853,14,I'm just trying to make you happy.
854,0,I understand why you're feeling so hurt right now.
854,1,But what?
854,2,"I know I messed up, and I'm truly sorry."
854,3,"You’re hurting, aren’t you?"
854,4,"Oh, Joey, I am so sorry you had to find out this way."
854,5,I'm here if you need to talk.
855,0,"Oh, what is it?"
855,1,I understand that concern.
855,2,That must be a relief to hear.
855,3,"Okay, I understand."
855,4,I understand this is a big decision for you.
855,5,I understand that must be frustrating.
855,6,I understand that can be frustrating.
855,7,That must have been really frustrating.
856,0,Hey.
856,1,"It was awful, I completely bombed."
856,2,"Oh, man, I'm so sorry to hear that."
856,3,I don't know... I thought I nailed it.
856,4,"Oh man, that really sucks to hear."
857,0,I understand.
857,1,That must be so frustrating and painful.
857,2,That sounds like a really difficult decision to make.
857,3,Good.
857,4,It’s okay to feel tired.
857,5,I understand.
857,6,"Of course, we can stay."
857,7,"Oh, okay, I understand."
857,8,I can see this is difficult.
857,9,I guess we could stay a little while longer.
857,10,That's really nice of you.
857,11,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
858,0,"Yeah, I can see why that would be a bummer."
858,1,"I know, I'm just messing around."
858,2,"Right, you do."
858,3,I can see why you'd be curious about that.
858,4,I can imagine.
858,5,I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
858,6,That must be disappointing.
858,7,"Yeah, that makes sense."
858,8,I understand why that would be reassuring.
858,9,That must be a pretty unsettling thought.
858,10,"Yeah, I can see how that would be a little unsettling."
858,11,I can see why you'd be feeling insecure.
858,12,"I'm sorry, that must feel disappointing."
858,13,"I'm sorry, that must be a hard truth to face."
859,0,"Oh, hey Phoebe. What's up?"
859,1,"Oh, Ursula, I didn't mean to upset you."
859,2,"Nothing, just the usual, you know, the crushing weight of existence."
859,3,"Oh, wow, that's… a lot."
860,0,I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must have made you feel.
860,1,I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
860,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
860,3,I understand you feel a strong connection.
860,4,"I understand, starting over can feel like a fresh start."
860,5,"I understand, let's try that."
860,6,I understand wanting to start fresh.
860,7,I'm ready when you are.
860,8,"Oh, wow."
860,9,"Oh, wow, that must be a difficult thing to hear."
860,10,"Oh, wow, that must be incredibly frustrating."
860,11,I can only imagine how disheartening that must be.
860,12,"Wow, that's a lot to process."
860,13,"Yes, I do."
860,14,I can see how that would make you feel proud.
860,15,That must feel like a lot to carry.
861,0,She's really struggling right now.
861,1,I'm so incredibly sorry to hear that.
861,2,"I'm… I'm not doing well, honey."
861,3,I haven't had time to think about it.
861,4,It's just...long.
861,5,I just haven't had time to get it cut.
861,6,Okay.
861,7,I just wanted to see you.
861,8,"I know, it's a lot right now."
861,9,I just don't know how to feel right now.
861,10,It must be overwhelming to think about all of that right now.
861,11,"It's a lot to think about, isn't it?"
861,12,"It's all just too much, isn't it?"
861,13,"I know, it's a lot to process."
861,14,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
861,15,Tell me.
861,16,"Yeah, those were the best."
861,17,"Yeah, she always had a stash."
861,18,"I know, right?"
862,0,Perhaps.
862,1,I know it feels like that right now.
862,2,"I'm sorry, I wasn't being clear."
862,3,"I'm sorry, I'm not following."
863,0,That sounds like a really gentle way to say goodbye.
863,1,"Oh, I can imagine that must be tough."
863,2,That must be so hard for the pet owners.
863,3,"Oh, honey, that's a tough image."
863,4,"It's a comforting thought, isn't it?"
863,5,"Yeah, I get that."
863,6,"Oh, Ronni, honey, come on in."
863,7,"What's wrong, Dad?"
864,0,I can see this is a big decision for you.
864,1,"I understand, you're feeling overwhelmed."
864,2,That sounds like it could be a little overwhelming.
864,3,"Oh, that's so incredibly kind of you to offer."
864,4,I'm just trying to be nice.
865,0,"Okay, I see it."
865,1,"Hi, I'm so nervous right now!"
865,2,"I'm Chandler Bing, and I'm with Monica."
865,3,"Oh, wow, that must feel really disappointing."
865,4,I understand how frustrating that must be.
865,5,I'm a friend of the bride.
865,6,I can't believe they didn't invite you.
866,0,I know this must be difficult.
866,1,I'm nervous too.
866,2,I can understand why you're feeling so strongly about this.
866,3,I understand this isn't what you want.
866,4,I understand you have a lot on your mind right now.
866,5,"This is important to you, isn't it?"
866,6,I understand this is overwhelming.
866,7,I can see how much this means to you.
866,8,I understand your worry.
866,9,I can't believe you're still doubting it.
866,10,I understand that must feel really disappointing.
867,0,"Okay, I'm here."
867,1,Oh? What's wrong?
867,2,I'm bracing myself.
867,3,"Oh no, what happened?"
867,4,"He did, and it was terrible!"
867,5,"Oh, no!"
867,6,You must be so frustrated!
867,7,"I understand, it's frustrating when they pick up things like that."
868,0,I understand that you're feeling really frustrated right now.
868,1,I understand how frustrating that must be.
868,2,How would I even begin to cope?
868,3,I understand this must be upsetting for you.
869,0,I can see why you're so enthusiastic.
869,1,"He just *is*, okay?"
869,2,I'm just not understanding.
869,3,That sounds like a really thoughtful approach.
869,4,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
869,5,It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and worried.
869,6,I understand this feels really frustrating right now.
869,7,I understand how frustrating this must be.
869,8,It sounds like you're really feeling stuck and unsure what to do.
869,9,I can see how frustrating this must be.
869,10,It's frustrating to feel like you're losing out.
869,11,"It's a truly awful feeling, isn't it?"
869,12,I know how much this hurts.
869,13,"It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?"
869,14,I can only imagine how terrible that would feel.
869,15,I can see how much this is stressing you out.
869,16,"It really does feel like it's never going to end, doesn't it?"
869,17,It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of this situation.
870,0,That sounds like a lot of work.
870,1,I'm glad you're excited!
870,2,"Oh, wow, that's a pretty small group so far."
870,3,I'm glad you're in.
870,4,"I understand, I'm a little apprehensive too."
870,5,"Okay, I can see why you'd want to keep it focused."
870,6,I'm glad you're excited about this!
870,7,Just discussing the party.
871,0,That's a fun idea!
871,1,"I'm just saying, it'd be a cool nod."
871,2,It sounds like you really have a soft spot for Chandler.
871,3,"Yeah, that's a really good point."
871,4,It sounds like you really love Chandler.
871,5,It sounds like you're really attached to the idea of Joey.
871,6,It sounds like you really love Joey.
871,7,"I'm just saying, it's your kid, it's your choice."
871,8,That sounds like a really special way to honor your loved ones.
871,9,That sounds like you're feeling a little conflicted.
871,10,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't know."
872,0,It must have been so hard for them.
872,1,It sounds like you're really shocked by the situation.
872,2,That must have been incredibly humiliating.
872,3,"I'm just saying, it must be hard for her."
872,4,You seem really upset by this.
872,5,I can see you're upset.
872,6,I'm just trying to understand.
872,7,It sounds like you're really proud of her.
872,8,It sounds like you're remembering some tough times.
872,9,"I just wanted to be left alone, too."
873,0,"Oh, that sounds like a lot of work."
873,1,Hi there.
873,2,"Hey, how are you doing?"
873,3,I'm all ears.
873,4,"I'm sorry, that's a lot of money."
873,5,"That's a lot to process all at once, I can imagine."
874,0,I just feel so lost and confused right now.
874,1,"Oh no, what happened with the bag?"
874,2,"I know, it's frustrating when something like that happens."
874,3,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
874,4,"I know it's hard, but maybe you're right."
874,5,"I understand, it's hard to let go of something you care about."
874,6,I know how much that bag means to you.
874,7,"I'm so sorry, Joey."
874,8,"It's okay, it's hard when you feel like you're being told to let go of something important."
874,9,I know how much you love that bag.
874,10,It sounds like you're really attached to it.
874,11,"I know, it's gotta be frustrating."
874,12,"I'm so sorry, Joey."
874,13,"I'm here for you, Joey."
874,14,"It's just so frustrating when people don't understand, isn't it?"
874,15,"I'm sorry, Joey, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
875,0,"Oh, I'm so relieved to hear that."
875,1,I hope you like it here.
875,2,That must be difficult to hear.
875,3,I understand your concern.
875,4,"Oh, no, not again."
875,5,"I know, it's frustrating."
875,6,That's incredibly frustrating.
875,7,"I know, I'm just trying to make this right."
875,8,I can tell you're feeling frustrated.
875,9,I understand this is frustrating.
875,10,This is so frustrating.
876,0,"Whoa, it sounds like you're really frustrated."
876,1,I understand your frustration.
876,2,"Yeah, you definitely did."
877,0,Hey there.
877,1,"Oh, no, is everything okay?"
877,2,That's really sweet of you to say.
877,3,Me too.
877,4,"I'm excited, too!"
878,0,Hey there.
878,1,What's up?
878,2,"Not really, no."
878,3,That sounds like a huge relief.
879,0,"Yes, of course, what's on your mind?"
879,1,I'm just feeling really overwhelmed right now.
879,2,"Oh wow, that sounds overwhelming."
880,0,"Yes, really."
880,1,"I am so sorry, I would never do that."
880,2,It's just that I wasn't ready for everyone to know yet.
881,0,I understand that's important to you.
882,0,It just feels like everything is crashing down around me.
883,0,I understand; it can be hard to share.
883,1,I just feel so embarrassed.
883,2,I'm listening.
883,3,"It's okay, take your time."
883,4,"It's alright, take your time."
883,5,I'm listening.
883,6,"Oh, wow."
883,7,"Oh, I’m sorry."
884,0,"Thank you, I really appreciate it."
884,1,"Okay, sounds good."
884,2,I'm glad we're on the same page!
884,3,It was just a friend.
884,4,"Oh, wow."
884,5,"Yeah, it's been a tough time."
884,6,Oh.
884,7,I can see why you're surprised.
884,8,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in!"
884,9,"Yeah, I just said that."
884,10,I can't believe this is happening.
884,11,I can see why you might think that.
884,12,It sounds like you're feeling pretty lost and confused right now.
884,13,I guess I can understand why you'd be concerned.
884,14,"I’m sorry, it sounds like you’re really feeling conflicted right now."
884,15,I just... I want you to be happy.
884,16,I’m just worried you’re going to get hurt.
884,17,I understand it can be confusing when things aren't straightforward.
885,0,I'm so sorry you feel invisible.
885,1,I feel like you're really struggling right now.
885,2,It sounds like you're feeling really conflicted right now.
885,3,I just don't know if I can.
885,4,I'm just trying to help.
886,0,Hey there.
886,1,How are you doing?
886,2,Of course!
886,3,"Oh, I see."
886,4,"Oh, wow, sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed."
886,5,I'm feeling a little lost right now.
886,6,I get that it's tough to resist.
886,7,"I know, it's a tough position to be in."
886,8,Hey!
886,9,Are you okay?
886,10,Just a little something to take the edge off.
886,11,I'm intrigued.
886,12,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
886,13,That sounds frustrating.
886,14,"Oh, wow, that sounds frustrating."
886,15,"Oh, that must have been a shock."
886,16,"No, they didn’t."
886,17,That sounds so frustrating.
886,20,"I know, it's frustrating."
886,21,"Oh, so this is about your plan, huh?"
886,22,"You're really excited about this, aren't you?"
887,0,I understand.
887,1,I don't know.
887,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening.
887,3,I understand that must have been a frightening experience.
887,4,"Oh, thank goodness."
887,5,"Oh, wow."
887,6,I can't believe you'd do that.
887,7,That must have been terrifying.
887,8,"Oh, wow, that must have been incredibly frightening."
887,9,That must have been incredibly difficult.
887,10,That must have been incredibly difficult.
887,11,That must have been incredibly difficult.
887,12,I can't believe you'd even suggest that.
887,13,I understand.
888,0,It sounds like you're really fired up about this!
888,1,I can't let fear stop me.
888,2,"You're really determined, aren't you?"
888,3,"I appreciate that, thank you."
888,4,"I understand your concern, but I'm sure I can handle myself."
888,5,"I appreciate you offering, but I'm good."
888,6,"Okay, then let's get you ready."
888,7,"Good, I'm glad you're feeling confident."
888,8,"I'm saying, if you can get in close, a swift kick there will take him down."
888,9,I'm ready.
888,10,Are you ready to get back out there?
888,11,"Oh, so you want to take him out, too?"
888,12,Focus your attacks on his hip.
888,13,"Oh, wow."
888,14,"You're really fired up, aren't you?"
888,15,This is great!
888,16,Oh...
888,17,"I'm still with you, man."
888,18,"Be careful out there, man."
888,19,"I'm right behind you, buddy."
889,0,Yes?
889,1,I think I'm in trouble.
889,2,Yeah?
889,3,"Oh, wow, that must have been frustrating."
889,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I really thought he was."
889,5,"Really! I can see why you'd think that, though."
890,0,"Hi, what's up?"
890,1,"No, he's not here right now."
890,2,"No, it's okay, I'll try again later."
890,3,"Oh, wow, I bet that's a lot to process right now."
890,4,I understand this is a shock.
891,0,That must feel amazing!
891,1,"It's such a special feeling, isn't it?"
891,2,That must feel incredible.
891,3,It must be amazing to feel that.
891,4,It must be incredible to feel that.
891,5,That must sting a little.
891,6,"Hey, how are you feeling?"
892,0,I just feel so incredibly overwhelmed right now.
892,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds stressful."
892,2,"Yeah, it's been a while since I've been employed."
892,3,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
892,4,"Oh wow, that's exciting!"
892,5,"Wow, that sounds like a really big deal."
892,6,"It’s a lot, I know."
892,7,That's amazing!
892,8,"That's great, but also, I'm nervous for you."
892,9,It's a new hot sauce I'm working on.
892,10,Oh no…
892,11,"Oh, man, I can only imagine how satisfying that must feel."
892,12,"Oh, wow, that's... intense."
892,13,"That sounds like a lot of work, but also kind of fun."
892,14,I can imagine you're feeling pretty excited about this.
892,15,That would be amazing.
892,16,I'm just excited for you!
893,0,"No, and it's starting to feel like it'll never happen."
893,1,"Oh wow, that sounds really frustrating."
893,2,"I know, it feels impossible sometimes."
893,3,"I'm right here with you, feeling that too."
893,4,"I'm here for you, always."
893,5,I understand.
893,6,"It's a lot to process, isn't it?"
893,7,I can't believe this is happening.
893,8,It sounds like you're feeling a bit apprehensive about this.
893,9,"You're really trying to make this work, aren't you?"
893,10,"Oh, Joe, I am so sorry."
893,11,"It's just... a lot to take in, huh?"
893,12,It would mean a lot to have someone you trust.
893,13,It's like you're saying you want someone you can trust.
893,14,I can't believe this is happening.
893,15,It really would?
893,16,I'm really glad you feel that way.
893,17,"Yeah, I think you can."
894,0,I can see you're feeling frustrated right now.
895,0,That must feel really hurtful and like they don't trust you.
895,1,"It just feels like they don’t trust me, you know?"
895,2,"I know, it’s ridiculous."
895,3,I just feel so betrayed right now.
895,4,"Oh, man, I can see how that would freak you out."
895,5,"I don't have a key anymore, remember?"
895,6,I understand how frustrating that must be.
895,7,I can see how frustrating that would be.
895,8,"I know this is frustrating, but we'll figure this out."
895,9,"I'm so sorry, I know this is frustrating."
895,10,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
896,0,That must be a relief.
896,1,"It's alright, it's just a bit of a bummer, you know?"
896,2,It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself.
896,3,"You're really trying to figure this out, aren't you?"
896,4,It sounds like you're really conflicted right now.
896,5,I understand.
897,0,That's wonderful to hear.
897,1,I understand how important that is.
897,2,That must be a confusing and difficult thing to witness.
897,3,"Of course, I will."
897,4,I'm glad we could agree on that.
897,5,Of course.
897,6,I can't imagine how difficult that must be.
897,7,It sounds like you're feeling conflicted.
897,8,It's hard when you disagree with someone you care about.
897,9,I hope so.
897,10,"It's hard to admit when you're wrong, isn't it?"
898,0,That's a lot of money.
898,1,"No, we're fresh out."
898,2,"Yeah, it sounds like you really went through a lot."
898,3,"Yeah, it's just... a lot to take on."
898,4,I'm just glad you're feeling good about things.
899,0,I understand.
899,1,"Oh, wow."
900,0,It's comforting to know you feel the same.
900,1,It's hard to feel that way about a place you're supposed to belong.
900,2,It sounds like you're feeling a little conflicted right now.
900,3,"I understand, it's hard to walk that back."
900,4,You're welcome.
900,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit unsure.
900,6,I understand.
900,7,Thank you.
900,8,You're very welcome.
900,9,Oh wow!
900,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncomfortable right now.
900,11,It sounds like you're feeling really uncomfortable.
900,12,I understand.
900,13,I can understand that feeling.
900,14,I understand.
900,15,I hear you.
901,0,"They look lovely, but are you feeling unsure about them?"
901,1,"Oh, I see."
901,2,It sounds like you're feeling a bit pressured to find the perfect gift.
901,3,What's wrong?
901,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
901,5,It sounds like you want to get her something really meaningful.
901,6,"Yeah, I understand wanting to find the perfect gift."
901,7,"That sounds, uh, not very fun."
901,8,"Yeah, I can see how you'd think that."
901,9,"Okay, I understand."
901,10,It sounds like you're really feeling conflicted about this.
901,11,I’m just trying to help you find the right gift.
901,12,"You're really struggling with this, aren't you?"
901,13,I can see this is really stressing you out.
901,14,"Oh, wow, that's… a lot."
901,15,"I know, right?"
901,16,"Oh, wow."
901,17,"I know, it’s a lot to take in."
902,0,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
902,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
902,2,"Oh man, I'm so sorry, I completely spaced on the crab cakes."
902,3,"I feel... pretty lost, actually."
902,4,"I feel lost, like I'm not sure what's happening."
902,5,"I know, it's hard."
902,6,I'm so sorry you're going through this.
902,7,I don't think I can.
902,8,I just want to help you.
902,9,"Oh, honey, you sound so nervous."
902,10,"Oh, honey."
902,11,"Oh, honey."
902,12,I can't believe how much pressure you're under right now.
902,13,I'm right here with you.
902,14,You seem nervous.
902,15,"It’s okay, I got you."
902,16,"I know, it's a lot of pressure."
903,0,I understand it's hard when you feel like something might be silly.
903,1,"Oh, wow."
903,2,I can see how that might feel overwhelming.
904,0,Okay.
904,1,"Oh, that must have been frustrating."
904,2,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
904,3,That sounds terrifying.
904,4,That sounds incredibly frustrating and scary.
904,5,I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been.
904,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating and unsafe.
904,7,It's okay to feel that way; it sounds incredibly frustrating.
905,0,It's disheartening when you feel alone in your choices.
905,1,That must be so lonely.
905,2,It's hard when someone is all alone.
905,3,"I'm sorry, that must have been frustrating."
905,4,"I know, it's overwhelming."
905,5,I'm so glad we're talking about her.
905,6,I can only imagine how difficult that must be.
905,7,It's okay if you're feeling conflicted.
905,8,"It's okay, we can always turn it off."
905,9,I know it's tough.
905,10,"It's tough, huh?"
905,11,"I understand, it's complicated."
905,12,It must be tough to feel that way.
905,13,"Oh, that's so sweet."
905,14,It's exciting to see something you're so passionate about.
905,15,"Oh, that sounds mortifying."
905,16,"Oh honey, that sounds rough."
906,0,You're welcome.
906,1,That's very thoughtful of you.
906,2,"You're welcome, sweetie."
906,3,I'm so glad you're here.
906,4,"Oh no, that's a bit of a letdown, isn't it?"
906,5,"It's alright, accidents happen."
907,0,"Yes, I'm here."
907,1,"I am so sorry, I didn't realize."
907,2,"That's not okay, though."
907,3,I just don't understand why it matters so much to you.
907,4,"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
907,5,I'm really scared right now.
907,6,I understand this must be a shock.
907,7,I'm really scared right now.
907,8,"I'm talking to you, you're the one I'm arresting."
907,9,"I am so sorry, I'm not going to apologize to a tree."
907,10,"I know it's frustrating, but you really should."
907,11,"I'm sorry, I just... I don't know what to say."
907,12,"It's okay, it's going to be alright."
907,13,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
908,0,"I understand, I'm here."
908,1,I understand.
908,2,I'm here.
908,3,I'm here.
908,4,"Okay, I'm coming."
908,5,"No, it's not the comet."
908,6,"Oh, that's awful."
908,7,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you."
908,8,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel bad."
908,9,"It's right here, see?"
908,10,"Oh, wow."
908,11,I don't know.
908,12,You seem really worked up about something.
908,13,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you."
908,14,I'm just trying to enjoy the comet!
908,15,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
908,16,You seem really upset.
909,0,I can see why you're so excited!
909,1,This is so exciting!
909,2,"It's so exciting to be here, isn't it?"
909,3,"I'm so glad you're here, Trudie!"
909,4,"It's nice to meet you, too."
909,5,"Yes, I am."
909,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit defensive.
909,7,"Alright, I'll bite."
909,8,You seem a little on edge.
910,0,"It was awful, I played so badly."
910,1,It sounds like you're hesitant to talk about it.
910,2,That's wonderful news!
910,3,"I know, right?"
910,4,"I know, right? It seems impossible."
910,5,"I know, right?"
910,6,I can hear the excitement in your voice!
910,7,It sounds like you're really moved by what he did.
910,8,It sounds like you're really proud of how well everyone played together.
910,9,Worried?
910,10,I'm afraid to ask.
910,11,I hear what you're saying.
910,12,I guess I just worry sometimes.
910,13,I guess you're right.
910,14,"I know what you mean, though."
911,0,That sounds like such a relief!
911,1,That sounds amazing!
911,2,I understand how frustrating that must be.
911,3,"I'm sorry, that must have been frustrating."
911,4,That sounds like a lot to take in all at once.
911,5,I can see why you'd feel that way.
912,0,What's wrong?
912,1,"Oh no, that sounds terrifying!"
912,2,That sounds really uncomfortable.
912,3,I can't believe this is happening.
912,4,That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.
912,5,"Yes, I'm burning up!"
912,6,I can't believe it's just you!
912,7,"Of course, go right ahead."
913,0,I understand that it's frustrating.
913,1,Thank you.
913,2,I understand you're frustrated.
913,3,"I'm just trying to have fun, jeez."
913,4,I do.
913,5,"You're worried about him, aren't you?"
913,6,That sounds really stressful.
913,7,I don't know if I can focus on writing after this.
913,8,"Sure, I'm in, but what are you thinking?"
913,9,I'm nervous now.
913,10,"Whoa, Chandler, that sounds dangerous!"
913,11,"I hear you, safety first."
913,12,"Oh, honey, I know that feeling."

913,14,"Oh, honey, you're really stressing me out."
914,0,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot."
914,1,"It's a seriously strong cocktail, but don't worry, I'll make it how you like it!"
914,2,Sounds like a fun night.
915,0,I'm just feeling so anxious right now.
915,1,"I'm just so nervous, is all."
915,2,I'm just so ready to meet them.
915,3,"I know it's scary, but you're doing great."
915,4,"Oh, sweetie, you're in so much pain."
915,5,"Oh, sweetheart, you're in so much pain."
915,6,I'm right here with you.

916,3,"It's nice to hear that, I'm glad."
916,4,I can hear the hesitation in your voice.
916,5,I understand.
916,6,Right.
916,7,I'm... I'm not sure.
916,8,"It’s okay, we can take our time."
916,9,"I know, it's a scary one."
916,10,Oh.
916,11,"I know, it's scary to think about."
916,12,"I’m sorry, I just… I don’t know what to say."
916,13,I know this is hard.
917,0,What's on your mind?
917,1,That sounds really nice.
917,2,That sounds like a perfect way to cheer you up.
917,3,I'm so sorry to hear that.

918,4,I can see this is a really big deal for you.
918,5,I understand how much this means to you.
918,6,That's a lot to carry on your shoulders.
918,7,That sounds really rough.

918,12,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure right now.
919,0,"Oh, that's such a letdown."
919,1,I guess I just got my hopes up too high.
920,0,I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been.
920,1,I can't imagine how terrifying that must feel.
920,2,I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been.
920,3,I can't imagine how terrifying that must have been.
920,4,I can see how much this means to you.
921,0,I know this must be incredibly painful to hear.
921,1,I…I don’t even know what to say.
921,2,I just… I don’t know what to say.
921,3,I can’t believe this is happening.
921,4,I understand.
921,5,I just need some time to process this.
921,6,I don't want to lose you either.
921,7,I understand that this is really upsetting.
921,8,I understand how painful this must be.
921,9,I'm so sorry.
921,10,I'm so sorry.
922,0,Hey there.

923,6,"I'm so sorry, that's awful timing."
923,7,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
923,8,"Not any of those, and I'm not sure how I feel about this."
923,9,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process."
923,10,Next week.
923,11,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process."

923,13,That’s so soon!
924,0,I can see how excited you are!
924,1,I'm so nervous; I don't know if I can.
924,2,"Okay, I understand you're feeling a little hesitant now."
924,3,"Okay, I understand."
924,4,"That's a clever plan, but are you feeling a little nervous?"
924,5,"I understand, it's tough to trust people after being hurt."
924,6,"I know, it's so frustrating when that happens."
925,0,Hey.
925,1,"Thank you, Chandler, that's very kind of you."
925,2,"Oh dear, I hope everything is alright."

925,7,I understand how frustrating that must be.
925,8,I believe you.
926,0,That sounds like a fun idea!
926,1,He said it would be a waste of money.
926,2,That must be frustrating.
926,3,It's okay to feel anxious about that conversation.
926,4,That sounds really difficult.
926,5,That sounds really hard.
926,6,It sounds like you're really dreading this conversation.
926,7,It's so hard when you know it's going to hurt.
926,8,That sounds like a really big step.
926,9,I'm here for you.
926,10,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
926,11,I guess I'm just scared too.
926,12,"It's not an easy thing to do, is it?"
926,13,I'm here for you.
926,14,Are you okay?
926,15,"Not really, I'm still pretty nervous."
926,16,"Oh, wow, that's a big step."
926,17,"No, Joey, we're not."
927,0,That sounds so disappointing.
927,1,"Oh, I see, you're frustrated by that."
927,2,"Yes, really."
927,3,"Wow, that's amazing!"

928,0,That must be disappointing to see.
928,1,That must feel like a real betrayal of trust.
928,2,That must be really disappointing to watch.
928,3,It’s good to feel that way.
928,4,"It’s a strange feeling, isn’t it?"
928,5,"Yeah, that sounds really good right now."
929,0,I can hear the joy in your voice!
929,1,"I know, it's just… a lot."
929,2,"Oh, that's nice to hear."
929,3,I can do that.
929,4,"Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
929,5,"Oh, honey."
930,0,Hey! What's up?
930,1,Hey! How's it going?
930,2,I'd like that.
930,3,"Nothing yet, I was hoping you had some ideas."
930,4,"Oh, man, that's rough."
930,5,...the best day of my life!
930,6,That sounds really frustrating.
930,7,"I know, it's not the best, is it?"
930,8,I know how much you love Die Hard.
930,9,I'm glad you're excited!
930,10,"I get it, you're really excited about this movie."
930,11,"I’m sorry, I got carried away."
930,12,"Oh, man, that's a bummer."
930,13,"Oh, man, that's a bummer."

932,4,"Oh wow, that's a big deal."
932,5,I can see you're worried about this.
932,6,"I know, it's different."
932,7,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you really regret it."
932,8,I can see that you're really upset right now.
932,9,I just don't know what to do anymore.
932,10,It sounds like you really feel strongly about this.
932,11,I appreciate you trying to talk me out of it.
932,12,"I understand, it sounds like you're really set on this."

932,14,I understand it's hard.
932,15,I'm not sure.
932,16,I know you're hurting.
933,0,What is it?
933,1,"He's one of my favorites, too."
933,2,"No, thanks, I'm good, Joey."
933,3,"No problem, be right back."

933,13,I understand you're just trying to be nice.
933,14,"Alright, alright, I'm on it."
933,15,I understand it can be frustrating when you feel singled out.
933,16,I’m just trying to be helpful.
933,17,I understand.
933,18,"Oh, come on, is that really necessary?"
933,19,"I'm just trying to get a coffee, that's all."
934,0,"That sounds fun, I wish I was there."
934,1,"Oh, hi, I'm sorry, we're not available."
934,2,"Oh, hi Heldi!"
934,3,"Oh wow, that's wonderful news!"
934,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been a shock."

935,8,"It's okay to feel this way, Monica."
935,9,"You're welcome, Monica."
935,10,"You're welcome, Monica!"
935,11,"Oh, no!"
935,12,Alright!
935,13,"Yeah, double or nothin'!"
936,0,"Oh, no, I'm sorry, I don't."
936,1,"I just feel so bad for those ducks, they look hungry."
936,2,"Oh wow, that's so exciting!"
936,3,I just need to get away for a while.
936,4,"Oh, wow, that's a really big deal."
936,5,"I’ll be careful, I promise."
936,6,"I know, it’s just… it’s a lot."
936,7,"I know, it's just, I have to try."
936,8,"I understand, it's a really tough situation."
936,9,"I understand, it's a really tough situation."
936,10,I guess I just want you to be happy.
936,11,I know how much you want this to work out.
936,12,I know it feels like you have to do this.
936,13,"I don't know, but I really hope so."
936,14,"Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry."
936,15,"I know, it’s just…it’s so hard."
936,16,It's like you're in a nightmare.
936,17,"Oh, honey, you're right, it is, isn't it?"
936,18,I know it hurts.
936,19,"I know, I know, it's just that it's not fair."
936,20,"Oh, honey, you really believe that, don't you?"
936,21,"Oh, honey."
937,0,"I think so, yeah."
937,1,"That's good, it can be tough to get places on time."
937,2,Okay.
937,3,"That's fascinating; please, continue."
937,4,"Oh, I see."
937,5,"Yes, it's quite a remarkable find."
937,6,I can see that you're really invested in this.
938,0,I appreciate you saying that.
938,1,I appreciate you saying that.
938,2,I understand that it’s a lot to ask.
938,3,I'm so glad to hear that.
938,4,I'm glad we could find some peace.
938,5,Bye.
938,6,Hello.
938,7,"No, she's not here right now."
938,8,"That's too bad, do you want to leave a message?"
938,9,"Oh, really?"
939,0,Hi there!
939,1,What's up?
939,2,"Not really, no."
939,3,Wow!
939,4,"I know, right?"
939,5,"No, I had no idea."
939,6,"I'm so sorry, I don't know what to say."
939,7,"Wow, that's a lot to process."
939,8,"Wow, that's a lot to process, isn't it?"
939,9,I can hear the uncertainty in your voice.
939,10,"I'm so sorry, this sounds like a lot to process."
939,11,"It's okay to feel unsure, this is a big deal."
939,12,"I guess it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, does it?"
939,13,"Oh, honey, that sounds really confusing."
939,14,"It's okay to feel unsure, even if everyone else seems certain."
939,15,"Okay, I get that this is a lot to process."
939,16,I can see you're feeling overwhelmed right now.
939,17,"Wow, you sound really conflicted."
939,18,It must be overwhelming.
939,19,"Oh, honey."
939,20,"This is a lot to process, isn't it?"
940,0,I'm so sorry to hear that.
940,1,That your cat went missing.
940,2,"Oh, that must be disappointing."
940,3,"It's alright, don't worry about it."
940,4,I feel terrible that I did that.
940,5,I am sorry to hear that.
940,6,It sounds like you needed a change.
940,7,I guess I've been putting that off.
940,8,I can see how that would be tough.
941,0,Night to you too.
941,1,Adiós.
941,2,"Oh no, whose is it?"
941,3,"Oh, good, I'm glad you found it."
941,4,Just some poetry.
941,5,"No, I haven't, but it sounds intriguing."
941,6,"It's a bit heavy, but I am finding it quite captivating."
941,7,"Oh, that's so disappointing when a translation ruins a book."
941,8,It's disappointing when a translation ruins a good book.
941,9,"Wow, that must be amazing."
941,10,"It's been hard to find the right words lately, hasn't it?"
941,11,"Wow, that sounds really beautiful."
941,12,"Yes, I am very distracted."
941,13,I'm suddenly very curious.
941,14,I'm glad you did.
942,0,I'm so excited for you!
942,1,This stop is Montreal.
942,2,"Oh, wow, you're making me blush."
942,3,"I'm sorry, did I say something that made you uncomfortable?"
942,4,I... I don't know what to say.
942,5,I can see this is a lot to take in.
942,6,I'm still trying to process this!
942,7,"Yes, I do."
942,8,That's a long trip.
943,0,"Oh, wow, another one?"
943,1,I sure hope so.
943,2,"Oh, that’s a shame."
943,3,"Alright, here we go."
943,4,"I just miss her baking, too."
943,5,I hope it's a good one.
944,0,I can see how much that matters to you.
944,1,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it was yours."
945,0,I'm so sorry to hear that; it sounds incredibly frustrating.
945,1,I just feel so stuck.
945,2,It sounds like you're really torn.
945,3,It sounds like you're really torn.
945,4,"It's okay, I know you didn't mean to."
945,5,"That sounds incredibly frustrating, and a bit insulting too."
945,6,"No, of course not, I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention at all."
945,7,"I know, it must feel awful to be stuck in a situation that's making you unhappy."
945,8,"I understand, it sounds incredibly frustrating."
945,9,"Wow, that actually sounds awful."
945,10,"Okay, I'll just be quiet then."
945,11,I'm really sorry.
945,12,"What's that, sweetie?"
945,13,"I'm just feeling so lost, you know?"
945,14,"Oh, wow, you’re still there?"
945,15,I do.
946,0,"I'm not sure, but I can try to find out for you."
946,1,I just feel like I missed something important.
946,2,"Oh, I get it, you're curious to see what the stars had to say."
946,3,"I know, it's always a little disappointing when it's wrong."
946,4,I'm so sorry.
946,5,"Oh, wow."
946,6,"You're really ready to take a chance, huh?"
946,7,I'm not sure I can be cool right now.
946,8,I'm so nervous for us right now!
946,9,"Okay, okay, I'm calm."
946,10,I'm so nervous right now.
946,11,I can't believe you're making me do this.
946,12,I'm so nervous right now.
946,13,"I am so tempted, though."
946,14,"I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm starting to feel a little panicked."
946,15,"Oh, the thrill of it all!"
946,16,"I know, I know, I panicked!"
947,0,"Oh wow, that's so exciting!"
947,1,"Yeah, still."
947,2,I can see how much this means to you.
947,3,I understand you might be hesitant.
947,4,That sounds like a threat.
947,5,"I think you're being deliberately difficult, and I'm hurt."
947,6,I'm really sorry to hear that.
947,7,I'm right behind you.
947,8,"Oh boy, here we go again."
947,9,"Oh, good, I could use a win."
947,10,I'm all ears.
947,11,Impressive.
947,12,Joey.
947,13,I see.
947,14,Thank you.
947,15,You seem very proud of yourself.
948,0,That sounds like a wistful kind of longing.
948,1,That's... unsettling.
948,2,That's... unsettling.
948,3,That's... quite a thing to consider.
948,4,I'm just trying to make light of things.
948,5,I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.
948,6,I'm glad you're feeling enthusiastic!
948,7,What would you like me to do?
948,8,That's wonderful!
948,9,"Ouch, that sounds rough."
948,10,I hear you.
948,11,"I'm sorry, that sounds really rough."
948,12,But?
948,13,But I just can't seem to find the words to say it.
948,14,Oh.
948,15,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you."
949,0,"I know, it's frustrating when the weather ruins your plans."
949,1,"I don't really feel like reading right now, though."
949,2,"Okay, what would you like to do instead?"
949,3,"I'm just feeling restless, I guess."
949,4,"Oh, that's a shame."
949,5,"Oh, I don't think that's my scene."
949,6,"Oh, that's a shame."
949,7,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated that your plans are being disrupted.
949,8,"Yes, Kate Miller!"
949,9,"Oh, you're on a roll!"
949,10,"Oh, honey... I'm so sorry."
949,11,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
949,12,You're welcome.
950,0,What's wrong?
950,1,It was my favorite pair.
950,2,I can only imagine how disappointing that is.
950,3,I can only imagine how frustrating that is.
950,4,I know how disappointing that can feel.
950,5,I'm looking.
950,6,I just want these pants off.
950,7,"Yeah, he thinks you're cool."
950,8,I guess it is kind of cool.
950,9,See? Ben's got it all figured out.
950,10,I feel like a cowboy.
950,11,"Yes, absolutely!"
950,12,"Oh, I'd love to see that."
950,13,Good idea.
950,14,I'm so happy for you!
950,15,"You really would, Ross."
950,16,"Okay, well, I'll see you later."
950,17,You'll feel so much better once it's done.
951,0,"I'm so sorry, I understand your frustration."
951,1,I feel so let down right now.
952,0,I'm glad you feel rested.
952,1,I feel so refreshed.
952,2,It's okay to feel that way.
952,3,I can understand why that might feel like a shift in the conversation.
952,4,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
952,5,I'm sensing some discomfort here.
952,6,I can see you're feeling a little uncomfortable.
953,0,Hey! What's up?
953,1,What's up?
953,2,Just staring at the ceiling.
953,3,"Oh, that sounds like a lot of work."
953,4,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly difficult."
953,5,"Oh, that's... intense."
953,6,"I understand, it sounds like you're really upset."
953,7,"I'm really glad to hear that, P."
953,8,I'm so relieved.
953,9,That's really brave of you.
953,10,I know you're worried.
953,11,"Oh, honey, I understand."
953,12,"I'm here for you, whatever you need."
953,13,I hope he's okay.
953,14,"I know, it's scary."
953,15,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
953,16,"I know, right?"
953,17,That's so sweet!
953,18,I'm just so happy for Bob!
953,19,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
953,20,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen."
953,21,"I'm so sorry, this is awful."
953,22,"Oh, honey."
954,0,That sounds comforting.
954,1,"Of course, Rach, I got it."
954,2,"Thanks, you're a lifesaver!"
954,3,You're welcome!
954,4,"That sounds really tough, Joey."
954,5,"I know, it can be tough."
955,0,"I know, but I still feel so awkward about it."
955,1,I understand that makes you feel like you weren't a priority.
955,2,I understand why you feel that way.
955,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit rejected.
955,4,Which puts you in a really awkward position.
955,5,I can see why you'd be feeling a bit anxious about that.
955,6,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
956,0,"Oh shoot, I'm so sorry, I completely lost track of time."
956,1,"Oh, are you feeling okay?"
956,2,I'm just not feeling up to it tonight.
956,3,I can see that this is hard for you to say.
956,4,That's really tough.
956,5,"No, I don't."
956,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds... complicated."
956,7,Sometimes.
956,8,That sounds really difficult.
956,9,I'm sorry to hear that.
956,10,"I'm sorry, that sounds really tough."
956,11,I'm so glad to hear that.
956,12,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like that."
956,13,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like that."
956,14,It sounds like you're feeling a bit torn right now.
956,15,"I'm sorry, I just... I have to go."
956,16,Oh.
957,0,I'm so sorry.
957,1,"Yes, it was."
958,0,I can imagine it felt that way.
959,0,"Oh wow, that must have been a shock."
959,1,"Oh, that must have been disappointing."
959,2,That must have felt really disappointing.
959,3,"I’m sorry, that must have been incredibly disappointing."
959,4,"I'm glad, I hope it makes you feel a little better."
959,5,I'm here to listen if you want to talk about it.
959,6,I can understand why you'd need that clarity.
959,7,"I understand, it's a lot to process right now."
959,8,I’m glad to hear you say that.
959,9,"That sounds like a lot to get through, but I'm here when you are."
960,0,"Oh my gosh, that's so bizarre!"
960,1,"Oh my god, that's awful!"
960,2,"Okay, I understand."
960,3,I can see that you're really disappointed with the meal.
960,4,"Oh, that's disappointing."
960,5,I can see why you're so frustrated.
960,6,It sounds like you're really passionate about your sauce.
960,7,I can tell you're really passionate about your food.
960,8,"Oh, wow, I can see why you're so defensive."
960,9,"Please, just calm down."
960,10,You must be feeling really frustrated right now.
961,0,I just felt so incredibly lost and alone.
961,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
961,2,I'm just...really not okay right now.
961,3,It sounds like you're really upset.
961,4,I understand you're upset.
961,5,I'm so sorry.
961,6,"Oh, wow, that's frustrating after all that effort."
961,7,Oh no!
961,8,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
961,9,"Yeah, it sounds like you need some time to yourself."
961,10,It sounds like you really need some space.
961,11,I understand.
961,12,It sounds like you really need some space right now.
961,13,Okay.
961,14,I understand.
962,0,I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
962,1,It truly was.
962,2,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
962,3,I'm overwhelmed.
962,4,"I'm so excited, and a little scared, too."
962,5,That's a lot to take in all at once.
963,0,"I know it's hard, but maybe you should take a break."
963,1,What did you know?
963,2,I just can't believe it.
963,3,It's so hard when you feel like you've been right all along.
963,4,This must be so painful to watch.
963,5,It's so frustrating when you feel like you've been right all along.
963,6,"It's like she's already moved on, and it hurts like hell."
963,7,"I know, it feels like she moved on so fast."
963,8,"I know, it feels like forever."
963,9,"I know, man, that must sting."
964,0,"Yeah, what's on your mind?"
964,1,I'm really nervous about it.
964,2,"Yes, I do."
964,3,"Okay, I'm listening."
964,4,"Oh no, what happened?"
964,5,"I'm so sorry, I'm all ears."
964,6,"Oh no, are you alright?"
964,7,Are you alright?
964,8,Are you okay?
964,9,Are you okay?
964,10,"Oh honey, that sounds really scary."
964,11,"It's okay, just breathe."
964,12,"It's okay, it's alright, just breathe."
964,13,"It's okay, we can come back to it later."
964,14,I can tell you're trying to be strong.
964,15,"It's okay, take your time."
964,16,"I understand, that must be really hard to say."
964,17,This is a hard thing to do.
965,0,I understand your frustration.
965,1,I'm not ready.
965,2,"I'm doing alright, but you sound stressed."
965,3,"Oh, that’s wonderful, Rach!"
965,4,"Oh, you're eager to see her!"
965,5,I miss her.
965,6,It sounds like you're really eager to see Monica.
966,0,"Oh, that sounds wonderful, I'm so happy to hear that."
966,1,I can't believe he said that.
966,2,"Oh, honey, that must be so hard to hear."
966,3,It's okay; it can be surprising.
966,4,"Oh, honey, I can imagine that was a shock."
966,5,I can understand why that would make you feel a little unsure.
966,6,"Okay, bye, honey."
966,7,Bye.
967,0,What's wrong?
967,1,"I know, it's so hard to believe."
967,2,"I know, right?"
967,3,I can't believe it!
967,4,"Oh, you're not enjoying it?"
967,5,"Yeah, totally, like a little Mia Hamm in there!"
967,6,That’s a good one!
967,7,"I know, right?"
967,8,"Wow, I can feel the excitement!"
967,9,"It’s okay, I’m here."
968,0,I'm listening.
968,1,I'm all ears.
968,2,"Wow, that's really something."
968,3,I do.
968,4,I'm so glad you're feeling this way.
968,5,"Oh, wow, that's a real letdown."
968,6,"I know, it's hard to hear."
968,7,I'm so sorry.
969,0,That's great!
969,1,It sounds like you're really hoping things can get better.
969,2,That sounds like a really thoughtful idea.
969,3,And you think he'd actually come?
969,4,That sounds like it would really help.
969,5,You really want to make things right.
969,6,That's so kind of you to offer.
970,0,"Yeah, I can understand that."
971,0,"I'm feeling a little left out, I guess."
971,1,"Yeah, maybe not *all* the time."
971,2,I guess I just feel left out.
972,0,"Oh, it's just not going well at all, is it?"
972,1,"Oh, good for you."
972,2,"Yeah, I'm glad too."
972,3,"Yeah, those were good times."
972,4,"That was a good time, wasn't it?"
972,5,That was a good time.
972,6,I do.
972,7,"Yeah, probably."
972,8,That sounds like a really happy memory.
972,9,That must have been a lot to process.
972,10,"Yeah, it was a lot to process."
972,11,"Oh, Cassie."
973,0,I'll try.
973,1,Let the sound wash over you.
973,2,"It's okay, take your time."
973,3,It's a place where I feel safe and at peace.
973,4,That sounds really lovely.
973,5,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stressed right now.
973,6,"I understand, it's hard when something you love is taken away."
973,7,I appreciate you offering.
973,8,"I understand, it's hard to let go of your own."
973,9,I'm just really trying to focus here.
973,10,Sounds beautiful.
973,11,It sounds like you're really struggling with that decision right now.
973,12,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
973,13,It's okay to feel that way.
973,14,I just feel so lost.
973,15,What's wrong?
973,16,I feel so lost right now.
973,17,It sounds like you're really trying to find some peace.
973,18,I know it's hard to let go of that feeling.
974,0,"Bye, Dad, I'm going to miss you."
974,1,"Bye, I love you."
975,0,Bye!
975,1,Bye.
975,2,Hey.
975,3,I'm just messing around.
975,4,Are you feeling okay?
975,5,I'm just messing with you.
975,6,"Sure, what is it?"
976,0,"Oh, wow, that sounds exciting!"
976,1,I'm so excited to share it with you!
976,2,"Sure, what's up?"
976,3,"I think I messed up, and I'm really nervous about it."
976,4,"Oh no, what's happened?"
976,5,"Oh, wow, I can imagine that's disappointing."
976,6,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
976,7,Oh.
976,8,I know this must be really hard for you to hear.
976,9,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
976,10,I know this must be really hard to hear.
976,11,I understand this must be really difficult for you.
976,12,"I'm so sorry, this is incredibly difficult."
977,0,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
977,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
977,2,Maybe a little.
977,3,"I understand, it's frustrating when you feel left out."
977,4,It sounds like it's bothering you that she's spending time with me instead.
977,5,I guess I am.
977,6,It sounds like this is really bothering you.
977,7,It sounds like you're feeling a bit defensive right now.
977,8,It sounds like you're feeling a little conflicted.
977,9,"Oh, sweetie."
977,10,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
977,11,"You don't think I get it, do you?"
977,12,It's okay to feel confused right now.
977,13,"Oh, wow."
977,14,That must feel really frustrating.
978,0,I missed you too.
978,1,I missed you so much.
978,2,I understand.
978,3,I understand.
978,4,I know.
978,5,I'm here.
978,6,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
978,7,"It's okay, we can turn around."
978,8,"I don't know, I'm so sorry."
978,9,"It's okay, we all have those moments."
978,10,I know.
979,0,I can imagine that must feel like a lot to take in.
979,1,"I'm so sorry, I can see how that would be confusing."
979,2,"Oh, wow, that must feel incredibly awkward right now."
979,3,I'm so sorry.
979,4,I'm so sorry.
979,5,"Oh, wow."
979,6,"Okay, I understand."
980,0,Yes?
980,1,How are you today?
980,2,"Not great, honestly."
980,3,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine."
980,4,"I'm really struggling to find the words, too."
980,5,I understand this is incredibly difficult.
980,6,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a really tough situation."
980,7,"I know it's difficult, but you're right."
980,8,I can see you're really struggling with this.
980,9,"This is a lot to process, isn't it?"
980,10,"That would be awkward, wouldn't it?"
980,11,"You're really not making this any easier, are you?"
981,0,Hey.
981,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
981,2,She completely shut me out.
981,3,Wow.
981,4,"I know, right?"
982,0,"Okay, I'm here."
982,1,That's a pretty good hand!
982,2,"Oh, wow, that's a tough beat."
982,3,"Wow, that's fantastic!"
982,4,"Yes, really!"
982,5,I have a seven and a jack.
982,6,"Aw, man, that's too bad."
982,7,"No, I'm not."
982,8,"Oh, man, I'm so sorry."
982,9,"Wow, that's amazing!"
982,10,I can tell you're feeling quite pleased with yourself!
983,0,"I'm so sorry, I can see how this must be confusing and upsetting."
983,1,"Oh no, that's frustrating!"
983,2,"I know, I’m so sorry."
983,3,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
983,4,"I’m so sorry, I’m trying to get out of here."
983,5,"Okay, but how can you do it from there?"
983,6,I'll be there as soon as I can!
983,7,"I know you're stressed, but please, just breathe."
984,0,"Not much, just feeling a bit down today."
984,1,"Yeah, I have. What are your options?"
984,2,"Ugh, I hate making those kinds of decisions."
984,3,That sounds like a tough choice.
984,4,"Wow, that's... unexpected."
984,5,I'm glad I could help!
985,0,"Oh, honey, that's awful, I'm so sorry to hear that."
985,1,"I'm really scared, Estelle."
985,2,Because you're scared.
985,3,"Oh no, that's awful."
985,4,I can see why you're angry.
986,0,"Oh, that must have been so frustrating."
986,1,"Oh, I can only imagine how frustrating that must have been."
986,2,"Oh, wow, that must have been rough."
986,3,"I know, it's just so frustrating."
986,4,It's just so unexpected.
986,5,"It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
986,6,It's tough to see someone you care about maybe not getting what they deserve.
986,7,"Oh, you sound disappointed."
986,8,What's up?
986,9,"Oh no, you can't be serious!"
986,10,"Oh, honey, you seem so disappointed."
986,11,"Oh, honey, you look absolutely devastated."
986,12,That must be so much to keep track of!
986,13,I can imagine how overwhelming all of this must feel right now.
986,14,"This is so hard for you, isn't it?"
986,15,This is so exciting!
986,16,It sounds like it's been a lot to keep bottled up.
987,0,That sounds like a really painful betrayal.
988,0,I'm sure it feels bittersweet.
988,1,"Yeah, it's a big life change for everyone involved."
988,2,I guess I'm just scared of losing what we have.
988,3,That sounds like a tough thing to imagine.
988,4,It sounds like you're worried about losing touch with them.
988,5,"It's hard to accept that, isn't it?"
988,6,It’s hard to think about the possibility of losing them.
988,7,I just don’t want to lose them.
989,0,"Oh no, that must be so frustrating."
989,1,I know it's frustrating when that happens.
989,2,I hope she's alright.
989,3,That would be terrible.
989,4,"Oh, that's a terrible thought."
989,5,"I know, it's a real worry."
989,6,It sounds like you really care about her.
989,7,"It feels wrong to take it, doesn't it?"
989,8,I'm right there with you.
989,9,Because we don't want her to find it!
989,10,"Oh no, this is getting tense."
989,11,"Okay, okay, let's get out of here!"
990,0,"Not much, just feeling a little lost, I guess."
990,1,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
990,2,I hate that feeling.
990,3,That must be frustrating to always see that.
990,4,It sounds like you're feeling a little frustrated right now.
990,5,It sounds like that's been a lot on your mind.
990,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit pressured by that idea.
990,7,It's tough when you start seeing your parents' lives and wondering about your own.
990,8,It's tough to feel like you're following in someone else's footsteps.
990,9,That must feel like a lot of pressure.
990,10,"No, I didn't."
990,11,That must have been a tough decision to make.
990,12,You made your own choices.
990,13,"Yeah, and look at me now."
990,14,That must have been a tough road.
990,15,That's a big hope to have.
990,16,"It's a scary thought, isn't it?"
990,17,I appreciate that.
990,18,"Of course, anytime."
990,19,"I'm here for you, pal."
991,0,Hello.
991,1,"I'm so sorry, I hope it still tastes okay."
991,2,"Oh no, it sounds like you were really looking forward to that dish."
991,3,I may have gotten distracted.
991,4,"Oh, so you were really craving that cheese."
991,5,I understand.
991,6,What's on your mind?
991,7,I'm so glad you like it!
991,8,I can see why you'd be worried.
991,9,"It's okay, we all start somewhere."
991,10,"It's okay, we all start somewhere."
991,11,I appreciate that.
991,12,"Oh, honey, it's okay, you're doing great."
991,13,I can't believe it!
991,14,"It's okay, it sounds like you are feeling a little insecure."
992,0,Hey! What's up?
992,1,How are you feeling today?
992,2,"Not great, honestly."
992,3,"Oh, that's nice of him."
992,4,I don't know.
992,5,"Oh, honey."
992,6,"It's okay, you don't have to explain."
992,7,It's hard when you're not sure how to feel.
992,8,"I understand, it's hard to feel obligated to spend time with someone you dislike."
992,9,I'm so glad we're on the same page.
992,10,"It's okay, I know."
992,11,"It's okay, I get it."
992,12,"It's just so frustrating, right?"
992,13,Maybe.
992,14,I know.
992,15,"It's alright, I get it."
993,0,Hey there.
993,1,How are you doing today?
993,2,"Just sitting here, feeling kind of lost."
993,3,"Oh, that must be frustrating."
994,0,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
994,1,"Oh, that must have felt pretty frustrating."
994,2,I'm sorry that happened.
994,3,I'm sorry you feel that way.
994,4,"Okay, I'm listening."
994,5,"I'm sorry, I understand this is hard."
994,6,I can understand why you'd want to know.
995,0,That sounds like a really frustrating situation.
995,1,"That's a really dark place to go, are you doing okay?"
996,0,I can only imagine how shocking that must have been.
996,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
996,2,That must have been really disappointing to hear.
996,3,"That must feel incredibly frustrating, especially after all the planning."
996,4,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated right now.
996,5,I can't believe she's doing this to you.
996,6,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated.
996,7,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
996,8,I'm just trying to understand why this is happening.
996,9,"I know, it feels like everything is falling apart."
996,10,"I know, it’s just… a lot to take in right now."
996,11,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
996,12,I know how much this means to you.
996,13,I just... I don't know what to do.
996,14,I can see how stressful this is for you.
996,15,Or we don't get married.
996,16,"You feel completely trapped, don't you?"
996,17,"You're really hurting right now, aren't you?"
996,18,I'm just trying to figure out what we're supposed to do.
996,19,I… I didn’t mean that.
996,20,I…I just feel so lost.
997,0,"Hey, how are you?"
997,1,Bye.
997,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
997,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you wanted to be the one to decide."
997,4,"Oh, no, not now."
997,5,Is everything alright?
997,6,"Oh, wow."
997,7,"I know, this is awful."
997,8,"I know, I know, it's devastating."
997,9,I am so sorry.
998,0,I just wanted to see my baby.
998,1,"Oh, Ma, you shouldn't have."
998,2,"I know, it's quite a lot to take in."
999,0,That sounds really sweet.
999,1,"Of course, I do."
999,2,That must be really special for you.
999,3,"Of course, I do."
999,4,"Oh, wow."
1000,0,I can understand why you'd feel that way.
1000,1,It's like he's still trying to get at us.
1000,2,It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now.
1000,3,I can't believe he left us with all of this.
1001,0,I understand that must be frustrating.
1001,1,That sounds utterly exhausting.
1001,2,"Oh no, that sounds unsettling."
1001,3,"Wow, that must have been such a shock!"
1001,4,"It's me, I got the job, and I'm terrified."
1001,5,"Oh, wow, that's amazing!"
1001,6,"Wow, that's a lot to take in all at once!"
1001,7,That sounds like a wonderful idea!
1001,8,That sounds like a wonderful idea.
1001,9,That sounds like a great idea!
1001,10,"That sounds amazing, I'm so happy for you!"
1001,11,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process."
1002,0,I'm not sure I know what to think right now.
1002,1,I'm so glad you feel that way.
1002,2,"It truly is, isn't it?"
1002,3,I am so excited to see it all come together!
1002,4,I can see you're really excited and just want to have some fun.
1002,5,"You're really getting into it, aren't you?"
1003,0,"Okay, I will."
1003,1,How are you feeling today?
1003,2,It must feel special to be here.
1003,3,It must be hard to let go of a place like this.
1003,4,I understand.
1003,5,"A little, yeah."
1003,6,"I'll get you something to drink, then."
1003,7,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
1004,0,"Okay, I understand."
1004,1,I'm so glad you like it!
1004,2,It feels so warm and inviting in here.
1005,0,"Not really, I'm feeling a bit down."
1005,1,"Great, I'm starving!"
1005,2,That sounds wonderful!
1005,3,"Oh, no! What's wrong?"
1005,4,"Oh, no, what's wrong?"
1005,5,"Alright, sounds like a plan."
1005,6,"Oh, you're worried about it?"
1005,7,I'm glad you think so.
1005,8,"Oh, that's frustrating."
1005,9,That's... frustrating.
1005,10,"Oh, you seem pretty bummed about the milk."
1005,11,"Oh, man, that sounds stressful."
1005,12,That sounds really inconvenient.
1005,13,I just feel so trapped right now.
1005,14,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
1005,15,"I just want things to be easy sometimes, you know?"
1005,16,"I hear you, it's frustrating when things aren't easy."
1005,17,That sounds really frustrating.
1005,18,You're welcome.
1005,19,"I'm sorry, it's just all getting a bit much, isn't it?"
1005,20,"I understand, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
1005,21,I can't believe this is my life right now.
1006,0,"I understand, it sounds like you're really upset about this."
1006,1,I know it’s hard to give up something you really want.
1006,2,"It's okay, I understand."
1006,3,I'm glad to hear that.
1006,4,I'm glad you're having a good time!
1006,5,"I know, right?"
1007,0,I just feel so lost and confused right now.
1007,1,I'm so sorry to hear that.
1007,2,"Oh, Brown Bird, I'm so sorry."
1007,3,"Oh, that must have been incredibly disappointing."
1007,4,It sounds like you're disappointed.
1007,5,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
1007,6,I feel like I've failed everyone.
1007,7,"I know, it's disappointing when things don't go the way you planned."
1007,8,"I'm so sorry, that really sucks."
1007,9,"I'm sorry, it's okay to feel that way."
1007,10,I understand how frustrating that must be.
1007,11,"I know, it feels like everything is falling apart."
1007,12,"I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
1007,13,I know how much you wanted this.
1007,14,That must feel so frustrating.
1007,15,"I know, it's just not fair."
1008,0,"It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?"
1008,1,I can see why that would be surprising.
1008,2,"Oh, really? I'm all ears."
1008,3,I'm here for you.
1008,4,I'm here for you.
1008,5,I know it's hard to talk about.
1008,6,I understand.
1008,7,"I'm sorry, that's a lot to deal with."
1008,8,"It's been a rough night for everyone, hasn't it?"
1008,9,That's gotta be tough.
1009,0,"It's okay, we understand."
1009,1,"It's okay, we're here to figure things out together."
1009,2,"It's okay, we can figure things out."
1009,3,"Yes, food sounds good right now."
1009,4,"I'm just overwhelmed, too."
1009,5,"I'm just feeling a bit lost, too."
1009,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
1009,7,"Oh, wow, that's...rough."
1009,8,"I wish, but no."
1009,9,Oh no...
1009,10,"Oh, wow, you're really on the same page, aren't you?"
1009,11,"Oh my god, you saw him too?"
1009,12,"I know, it's overwhelming."
1009,13,I am so incredibly jealous right now.
1009,14,"Oh, honey."
1009,15,"Oh, honey."
1009,16,I can't believe this is happening!
1009,17,I'm so excited!
1009,18,I think I'm more excited about the pizza.
1010,0,What game is that?
1010,1,Monopoly!
1010,2,I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
1010,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
1010,4,I am so uncomfortable right now.
1010,5,I understand that you're not comfortable with that.
1010,6,I can see why you're upset.
1010,7,You're welcome.
1010,8,I'm so glad you're feeling better.
1010,9,"I understand, it can be a bit much."
1010,10,"I understand, it's really tough to feel pressured like that."
1010,11,I understand; it sounds like you're feeling really uncomfortable.
1011,0,"I'm just... feeling a little overwhelmed, that's all."
1011,1,"Yes, to do my business."
1011,2,I'm just messing with you.
1011,3,"Oh, come on, don't be like that!"
1011,4,It sounds like you've made a tough decision.
1011,5,"I know, it can be tough to commit."
1011,6,I'm just trying to keep things moving.
1011,7,That sounds important.
1011,8,I'm sensing a bit of playful rivalry here.
1011,9,"You really put some effort into this, didn't you?"
1011,10,That's quite a lineup!
1011,11,You seem really invested in these choices.
1011,12,"You're right, it's a little out there."
1012,0,That must be incredibly frustrating.
1012,1,I'm going into the tenth grade.
1012,2,"Oh wow, that must feel kind of strange."
1012,3,"Oh, honey, I can see how that would be frustrating."
1012,4,I understand how frustrating that must be.
1012,5,I understand this is frustrating.
1012,6,"It's alright, I understand how you feel."
1012,7,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a lot to deal with right now."
1012,8,I understand this is a big deal for you.
1012,9,I can see why you're feeling frustrated.
1012,10,"I just want someone who knows what they're doing, you know?"
1012,11,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
1013,0,"Oh no, are you serious?"
1013,1,"Oh, that sounds really overwhelming."
1013,2,I just wish there were more of me right now!
1013,3,"Okay, I understand."
1014,0,"I left it at home, I'm so sorry."
1014,1,"I'm just doing my job, sir."
1014,2,"Oh, I see."
1014,3,"I'm sorry, I really don't."
1014,4,"He’s a good boy, I bet."
1015,0,"Yeah, I could really use a strong one right now."
1015,1,"They're really hitting the spot, huh?"
1015,2,"Oh, thank you so much."
1015,3,"Yeah, I'll have them to you by end of day."
1015,4,"No problem, I'll get them to you."
1015,5,"Okay, great."
1015,6,"Yeah, I get that."
1015,7,I can see how that would be frustrating.
1015,8,Right.
1015,9,It sounds like there's a lot on your plate right now.
1016,0,I understand.
1016,1,"Yeah, it's a lot to take in."
1016,2,That must feel really awful.
1016,3,It sounds like you’re really trying to focus on the positive.
1016,4,I'm sure she will be.
1016,5,"I'm sure we do, let me go check."
1016,6,"Oh, that's a shame, I know how much she loves these."
1016,7,"I know, it's rough, but we'll figure it out."
1016,8,I'm scared.
1016,9,"Oh, honey, are you alright?"
1016,10,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
1016,11,"Oh no, that sounds really stressful."
1016,12,I know this is a tough spot.
1016,13,"I’m so sorry, that sounds awful."
1016,14,"That sounds really rough, I'm so sorry."
1016,15,"Oh, Rach, you're the best."
1016,16,"I understand, it's tough to be in this position."
1016,17,I just... I don't want to.
1016,18,"I can be pretty persuasive when I need to be, huh?"
1016,19,"Oh, honey."
1016,20,It must be incredibly painful to feel like you're being punished for something you didn't do.
1016,21,It's okay to feel this way.
1017,0,"I understand, it's hard to carry that weight."
1017,1,It's a heavy burden to carry.
1017,2,It's okay to feel that way.
1017,3,I understand why you'd feel that way.
1017,4,That sounds incredibly stressful.
1017,5,I'm so sorry you're in this position.
1017,6,I understand.
1017,7,I'm not wearing any leather.
1017,8,"It's just a lot to take in, isn't it?"
1017,9,I know you're upset.
1017,10,You're so happy!
1017,11,"It's a really good coat, isn't it?"
1017,12,"Oh, yes, I do."
1017,13,I loved Phil Huntley.
1018,0,"Yeah, he tries, but sometimes it’s just… awkward."
1018,1,What's wrong?
1018,2,"I'm sorry, that sounds awful."
1018,3,It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now.
1018,4,I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
1018,5,This is really tough.
1018,6,"I know, I messed up."
1018,7,"It's just that you seem so calm, and I'm not."
1018,8,I know this is really upsetting for you.
1018,9,I understand.
1018,10,Of course.
1018,11,"I'm really sorry, Rachel."
1018,12,I'm just trying to understand what's happening here.
1018,13,"I’m just…really disappointed, Ross."
1018,14,"I know, I know, it's not that simple."
1018,15,I can't believe this is happening.
1018,16,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
1019,0,"Sure, I can do that for you."
1019,1,"Oh, no worries, what's wrong?"
1019,2,I understand that must be frustrating.
1019,3,"Oh, I see."
1019,4,I understand how frustrating that must be.
1019,5,"I understand, that's a long wait."
1019,6,"I understand that's frustrating, especially with a show to get to."
1019,7,I understand your frustration.
1019,8,I understand it's frustrating when things don't go as planned.
1019,9,I can see why you're frustrated.
1019,10,It’s incredibly frustrating when things feel unfair like that.
1019,11,"Okay, I understand, it's frustrating to feel pressured like this."
1019,12,"I understand, it's frustrating when you feel pressured like this."
1019,13,I'm sure you can.
1019,14,I understand; it's frustrating when you're on a tight schedule.
1019,15,"I understand, it's frustrating when you're pressed for time."
1019,16,I understand; it's frustrating when you're in a rush.
1020,0,"Okay, I understand."
1020,1,I appreciate your understanding.
1020,2,"Oh, I'm just teasing!"
1020,3,"Oh wow, that's a little nerve-wracking, isn't it?"
1020,4,"Oh really, what's that?"
1020,5,I am completely serious.
1020,6,"Of course, I can help."
1021,0,"That sounds like a lot of work, but I appreciate the offer."
1021,1,"Okay, I understand."
1021,2,I know how frustrating that can be.
1021,3,"I know, it’s the worst."
1021,4,"Yes, it really does."
1021,5,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1021,6,I am so sorry.
1022,0,"Hey, not much, just feeling a bit down, you know?"
1022,1,"Whoa, easy there."
1022,2,"Oh, you okay?"
1022,3,That sounds like a lot of work.
1022,4,Did what?
1022,5,I just… I don’t know.
1022,6,"I'm just trying to have a little fun, is all."
1022,7,"Oh, Joey."
1022,8,Maybe.
1022,9,"I'm so hurt, Joey."
1022,10,I just wanted to see what you were hiding.
1022,11,"I know, I shouldn't have left it out."
1022,12,I'm really sorry; I didn't mean to upset you.
1022,15,I guess not.
1022,16,"I'm sorry, Zelda, I didn't mean to upset you."
1022,17,"I can't believe you looked at it, Joey."
1023,0,"Me too, I could really use something to munch on."
1023,1,"Ooh, that sounds tempting!"
1023,2,"Oh, that's a shame."
1023,3,"I know, it's disappointing when you don't like something."
1023,4,"Oh wow, that sounds really painful."
1023,5,I can see how that would be a difficult thing to navigate.
1023,6,I can see why you feel so strongly about that.
1023,7,"I'm so sorry, that must have been a really difficult experience."
1024,0,Hello there!
1024,1,How are you doing today?
1024,2,Thank you.
1024,3,"Okay, I am ready to listen."
1024,4,I'm so glad you're taking the time to do this.
1024,5,"I understand, it's important to find the right fit."
1024,6,"Oh, a test?"
1024,7,Sounds fun!
1024,8,"Okay, here we go."
1024,9,Soft.
1024,10,"Oh wow, that's intense."
1024,11,Guilty.
1024,12,Intriguing.
1024,13,Hugs.
1024,14,Interesting.
1024,15,Oh.
1025,0,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was bothering you."
1025,1,I just don’t want people to stare.
1025,2,"I'm just trying to relax, is that so wrong?"
1025,3,"I'm sorry, I know this is frustrating."
1025,4,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
1025,5,"I know this is frustrating, but let's try to stay calm."
1025,6,It sounds like you're really excited about this.
1025,7,"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to keep up."
1025,8,"I know, I know, I'm just trying to help."
1025,9,I'm just trying to make sure everything goes smoothly.
1025,10,It sounds like you're feeling really stressed about this.
1025,11,I know you don’t want to mess this up.
1025,12,I can see you're really stressed about this.
1025,13,"It's just a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
1025,14,I know it's hard to be the one to share such news.
1025,15,"I know this is tough, but we'll get through it together."
1025,16,"Sure, what is it?"
1025,17,"I understand, it's important."
1026,0,"Oh, you're making me blush!"
1026,1,That's such a sweet story!
1026,2,"Aww, that's so sweet."
1026,3,I can see why!
1026,4,"It's nice to feel so loved, isn't it?"
1026,5,"Oh wow, that must have been quite a surprise."
1026,6,That sounds really confusing and a bit unsettling.
1026,7,"Oh, wow, that must be a lot to take in."
1026,8,"It's just a hunch, but it's making you feel uncomfortable, isn't it?"
1026,9,"Oh no, are you okay?"
1026,10,"Oh, that must have stung."
1026,11,"I'm sorry, that sounds really hurtful."
1026,12,"Oh, I see, so you're saying I'm not attractive to her?"
1026,13,"Oh, honey, that sounds really confusing."
1026,14,"Yeah, that one."
1026,15,I just don't know what to say.
1027,0,"Oh, hey Phoebe."
1027,1,"Of course, come in, I'm here."
1027,2,"Oh, Phoebe, I am so incredibly sorry."
1027,3,"Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry."
1027,4,I'm so incredibly sorry.
1027,5,I can't believe this is happening.
1027,6,"I'm so sorry, Phoebe."
1028,0,"Three years is a long time, that's wonderful!"
1028,1,"Oh wow, that's a long time!"
1028,2,"Wow, that must have been a little awkward."
1028,3,It's okay to feel a little down about that.
1028,4,That must have been a long time ago.
1028,5,It's wonderful that you found someone.
1029,0,"It's just been a lot lately, and I'm feeling overwhelmed."
1029,1,"Oh wow, it sounds like you had a lot of fun together."
1029,2,"It was a simpler time, wasn't it?"
1029,3,I do.
1029,4,I'm glad I could make you laugh.
1029,5,"Yeah, you are."
1029,6,I'm so glad you think so.
1029,7,I'm really glad to hear that.
1029,8,I'm all ears.
1029,9,"Oh no, what happens then?"
1029,10,You want to hear more?
1029,11,That’s a classic!
1029,12,"Oh man, that’s just awful!"
1029,13,"Oh, you really want to?"
1029,14,"Oh, so you think I'm trying to trick you?"
1030,0,"Hey, what's up?"
1030,1,"No, it's not."
1030,2,"I know, I'm really sorry."
1030,3,I just don’t understand why.
1030,4,"No, I didn't tell anyone."
1030,5,That's a relief.
1031,0,That must be really frustrating to hear.
1031,1,"I'm sorry, that must feel really frustrating."
1031,2,"I'm really sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
1031,3,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
1032,0,"Not really, and it makes me kind of sad, actually."
1032,1,"Not really, it's been a while."
1032,2,"Oh, that's really nice that you have that connection."
1032,3,"Oh, that's nice, seeing someone regularly like that."
1032,4,It sounds like you have a lot of friends from back then.
1032,5,"Wow, that's a lot of names."
1032,6,"Yeah, I guess so."
1032,7,"Yeah, it's funny how things change."
1032,8,"He's doing well, but it felt a little awkward catching up."
1032,9,"Oh wow, that must have been really tough for him."
1032,10,That must make you feel a little ashamed.
1032,11,I bet that's a little embarrassing for him.
1033,0,"Oh, that must be disappointing."
1033,1,"Yeah, it's a bit of a letdown, isn't it?"
1033,2,That must be a really intoxicating feeling.
1033,3,I guess it's hard to let that feeling go.
1034,0,"Oh, that's really nice of you!"
1034,1,How are you doing today?
1034,2,Hi.
1035,0,I understand this is upsetting.
1035,1,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
1035,2,"I'm so sorry, this is really hard."
1035,3,It’s just…disappointing.
1035,4,"I know, it's tough."
1035,5,"Oh, wow, that's… that's amazing."
1035,6,I'm so sorry you're hurting.
1036,0,"Oh, wow, you seem really excited!"
1036,1,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that."
1036,2,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
1036,3,"Oh, Stanley, I am so sorry to hear that."
1036,4,I wish I were.
1036,5,"Oh, man, I am so sorry."
1036,6,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
1036,7,I can't believe this is happening.
1036,8,"I know, it's tough, but we'll figure something out."
1036,9,This is a disaster.
1036,10,I wish I had a better answer for you.
1036,11,This is unbelievable.
1036,12,"I know, it's just... it's a lot to take in."
1036,13,I really hope you're right.
1036,14,"No, I'm not."
1036,15,"I am so sorry, this really stinks."
1036,16,"Of course, I will."
1036,17,Yeah.
1036,18,"Oh man, that's gotta be a blow."
1036,19,"Oh, wow."
1036,20,"Oh, thanks."
1037,0,"No, I ate them all."
1037,1,"Oh, no worries, I can check."
1037,2,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little frazzled right now."
1038,0,Hey yourself.
1038,1,How are you doing?
1038,2,She was...a lot.
1038,3,"Oh, wow."
1038,4,"No, it wasn't that."
1038,5,"Oh my god, that sounds awful."
1038,6,It's okay to feel a little dramatic right now.
1038,7,That must have been really unsettling.
1038,8,"I'm sorry, that must be really frustrating."
1038,9,You're hurting.
1038,10,I'm really sorry you're going through this.
1038,11,That sounds like it was a real turnoff for you.
1038,12,I can understand how something like that could be a dealbreaker.
1038,13,You.
1038,14,"I know, right?"
1038,15,"No, man, we're not."
1038,16,I can't believe you'd do that to me.
1038,17,"I'm sorry, man."
