9,0,"Whoa, are you okay?"
9,1,"It's okay, you're alright."
9,2,"That's a relief, but still, it's a lot to deal with."
9,3,"That's a relief, at least."
9,4,That sounds really upsetting.

11,1,"I know, it's so frustrating when things don't go as planned."
11,2,"Oh, honey, that sounds so stressful."

12,0,"I know, it feels ridiculous, doesn't it?"
12,1,I just don't understand why you two would be so upset.
12,2,I understand it's hard to see us like this.
12,3,I understand that you're upset.
12,4,"I'm trying, but it's not working."
12,5,"This isn’t easy, is it?"
12,6,"I know, and it's the hardest thing to watch this happen."

17,0,"Oh, I bet you have some great memories of those times."
17,1,"Oh, that must have been fun."
17,2,"Oh, wow, that must have been fun."
17,3,That sounds like a vivid memory.
17,4,"Oh, that sounds like a stressful memory."
17,5,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine what you're going through right now."
17,6,"It's alright, you deserve to be angry."
17,7,That's incredibly frustrating and disrespectful.
17,8,"It's just so infuriating, isn't it?"
17,9,It's just so frustrating to see him profit like this.
17,10,I know it's so frustrating.
17,11,I am so sorry.
17,12,I can't believe he's doing this to us.
17,13,I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.

17,24,"I hear you, it's incredibly frustrating when things don't go as planned."
17,25,"This is hard, I know."
17,26,"Oh, honey, I can see how frustrating this is for you."
17,27,I just want this to be over.
17,28,"Oh, honey, I know how much this means to you."
17,29,"I know, it's so frustrating when things seem impossible."
17,30,"This is so hard, I know."
17,31,"I hear you, honey."
17,32,"I know, it’s like reliving your childhood all over again."
18,0,I can see how that would feel embarrassing.
18,1,I can see how that would make you feel uncomfortable.
18,2,"This is so stressful, isn't it?"
19,0,"Yes, I know, it's disappointing."
20,0,"Okay, I understand."
20,1,I just don't want anyone to make fun of me.
20,2,"Oh, wow, you're really excited about this, aren't you?"
20,3,"Wow, you seem really frustrated."
20,4,I understand.
20,5,I just want to be fashionable!
20,6,"Oh, wow, you're really frustrated."
20,7,"Oh, Joey."
21,0,"No, I haven't. I'm terrified."
21,1,It sounds like you're feeling optimistic but also a little nervous.
21,2,"It's still tough, though, right?"
21,3,That's a lot to consider.
21,4,"I understand, it's a difficult thing to think about."
21,5,I love you too.
21,6,"I know this is hard, but I'm here for you."
22,0,Hey there.
22,1,What's up?
22,2,"Yeah, it really did."

22,6,I'm so sorry.
22,7,"I don't know, I just thought..."
22,8,I'm so sorry that happened.
22,9,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
22,10,"I know, right?"
22,11,"No, I don't think so."
22,12,I’m glad you think so.
22,13,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
22,14,I can't believe you'd end things over that.
22,15,"I'm sorry, but you're hurting."
22,16,"I know, but it's just…a lot."
22,17,I'm glad you feel that way.
22,18,I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
22,19,I'm not sure if that's what I want.
22,20,I'm... surprised.
22,21,What are you thinking?
23,0,Hey there.
23,1,"I do, but it's your decision, and I want you to be happy."
23,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
24,0,"Yes, of course, I'm listening."
24,1,I'm all ears.
24,2,I understand.
24,3,That sounds exciting and a little nerve-wracking!
25,0,I don't know what to say.
25,1,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it was still bothering you."
25,2,"I know, it really did hurt."
25,3,I feel terrible about hurting you.
25,4,Are you alright?
25,5,"I'm so sorry, are you alright?"
25,6,What?
25,7,I wish!
25,8,I can only imagine how much that hurts.
25,9,I can understand why that would be a bit hurtful.
25,10,I guess that's what you think.
25,11,I really do.
25,12,"Wow, that must have stung."
25,13,I’m right here.
25,14,I'm all ears.
25,15,"You know, you're right, I did."
25,16,You must be feeling really hurt right now.
26,0,That's fantastic!
27,0,Hey there.
27,1,How are you doing today?
28,0,Down.
28,1,"Sure, go ahead."
28,2,"Of course, I understand."
28,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds awful."
28,4,It was a really awful experience.
28,5,"I'm sorry, that sounds really tough."
28,6,"I understand, it's tough to talk about those things."
28,7,"Oh, wow, that sounds mortifying."
28,8,That sounds like a really awkward situation.
28,9,That sounds awful.
28,10,That sounds really frustrating.
28,11,I'm so sorry; I can't imagine how difficult that must be.
28,12,It must be hard to be here.
28,13,I know how it feels to visit someone.
28,14,That’s really nice to hear.
28,15,"Oh, you must be terrified right now."
28,16,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
29,0,I'm so glad to hear that.
29,1,"That's such a bummer, I'm sorry."
29,2,"That's a relief, I was starting to sweat a little."
29,3,That's a relief!
29,4,I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
29,5,"Oh no, what is it?"
29,6,I can't.
29,7,"I understand, it's frustrating when you can't have what you want."
29,8,"I know, but these are different somehow."
29,9,I understand; sometimes it's just not the same.
29,10,"I'm so sorry, I know how you feel."
29,11,"You're very welcome, I'm glad you enjoyed it."
29,12,"I know, it's the best, isn't it?"
30,0,I feel so lost and confused right now.
30,1,"Oh, honey, that sounds terrifying."
30,2,"Yeah, but I didn't like it."
30,3,"Oh, that sounds a bit rough, actually."
30,4,"Oh, that sounds like a disaster!"
30,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
31,0,"Yeah, I could really use a hand."
32,0,"It's okay, I understand; it's a lot to take in."
32,1,Sangria sounds perfect right now.
32,2,You seem really happy right now.
32,3,I understand.
32,4,I can only imagine how much that would mean to you.
32,5,That must be really hard.
32,6,"Okay, wow, that's a lot to process, and I'm here for you."
32,7,Tell me.
32,8,"Oh wow, you must be so excited to hear this!"
32,9,"Oh, wow."
32,10,"Yeah, it sounds like it was tough."
32,11,"Yeah, it was, uh, it was a lot."

33,2,"Oh, no, that sounds terrifying!"
33,3,I can't imagine how frustrating this must be.
33,4,"Oh, thank goodness!"
33,5,"Oh, bless her heart."
33,6,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
33,7,"I know, it's so frustrating when they won't settle."
33,8,It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now.
33,9,"I know, it's so incredibly frustrating when they just won't settle."
33,10,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating when you're this exhausted."
34,0,I know it must feel really frustrating to hear that.
34,1,I can see why you feel that way.
34,2,I can see how that would feel frustrating.
34,3,"Yes, I have."
34,4,I just feel so… left behind.
34,5,I can't believe you thought that.
34,6,"I'm so sorry, that must be a lot to deal with."
34,7,"I understand, it must be frustrating."
34,8,That sounds really lonely.
34,9,It sounds like you're really hoping this Roger is the one.
34,10,That sounds like a really difficult decision to make.
34,11,It sounds like you're really torn.
34,12,I can't believe you're finally ready.
34,13,I know you've been wanting to for a while.
34,14,You sound like you're really ready for this.
34,15,"You're absolutely right, it should be freeing."
34,16,"It’s just, so much pressure, isn’t it?"
34,17,"I know, I know, but I'm just saying..."
34,18,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that."
35,0,I can see you're really focused.
35,1,I can't believe it!
35,2,I'm so sorry I'm late.
35,3,I'm so glad you're back.
35,4,"Just breathe, you're doing great."
36,0,I'm on my way.
36,1,I understand your hesitation.
37,0,That must feel really awful.
37,1,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt right now.
37,2,That sounds like a really intense feeling.
37,3,I guess I can see how that would be upsetting.
37,4,It sounds like you're feeling really cornered right now.
37,5,"Oh, so you're feeling pressured right now?"
37,6,I understand you're not sure how this will help.
37,7,"Oh, Chandler..."
38,0,"That's amazing, congratulations!"
38,1,That's so sweet of you to say!
38,2,"Of course, I'd love to help you."
38,3,"It's for the lead in ""Hamlet!"""
38,4,"Oh wow, that's fantastic!"
39,0,"No, I haven't, but I hope you find him."
39,1,"No, and I'm starting to get worried."
39,2,"Oh no, is he lost?"
39,3,"Oh, I see."
39,4,"No problem, buddy."
39,5,"Oh, you're worried he might spoil the surprise."
39,6,That must have been quite a sight.
39,7,"I guess I'm just a little worried, then."
39,8,"Oh, you're right, I remember now."
39,9,"I know, I know, it's a lot to take in right now."
39,10,"Oh, sweetie, I'm worried too."
39,11,"Okay, I'm not worried."
40,0,That's great to hear!
40,1,I can understand why that would be difficult to think about.
41,0,"I guess so, but I'm still feeling a little awkward about it."
41,1,"Oh wow, that's... quite a thing."
41,2,That must be incredibly disappointing.
41,3,"Yeah, I get how disappointing that must be."
41,4,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly disappointing."
41,5,"I just thought we had something real, you know?"
41,6,"I'm sorry, that must be really disappointing."
41,7,I'm sorry you're feeling down.
41,8,"I know, it's the worst."
41,9,What's wrong?
41,10,I can tell this is really important to you.
41,11,Why?
41,12,"Yeah, it's okay to be girls."
42,0,You're welcome.
42,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
42,2,"I'm so sorry, of course."
42,3,I appreciate that.
42,4,I understand.
42,5,I just don't think I can.
42,6,"Oh, wow."
42,7,That must have been frustrating.
42,8,"Oh, wow, that must have been a tough call to make."
43,0,That sounds like fun!
43,1,The [team name] are playing [opponent team name].
43,2,"Oh, right, which game?"
43,3,"Yeah, I've been feeling a bit down lately."
43,4,It sounds like you're feeling pretty burnt out.
43,5,"I'm just saying, it's nice to have a break sometimes."
43,6,"It's okay, you don't have to."
44,0,"I don't know, but it's really bothering me."
44,1,"I understand, it must be difficult."
44,2,I'm just not ready to talk about it.
44,3,"Oh, wow."
45,0,"I'm just not feeling it today, okay?"
45,1,"Oh, honey, I just need you to get ready."
45,2,"Oh, wow, I can feel how important this is to you."
45,3,"Yes, really, now let's go, please!"
45,4,I'm so glad you're excited!
45,5,"You're welcome, Phoebe."
45,6,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
45,7,"Okay, okay, I'm going!"
45,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds difficult."
46,0,"Oh no, what happened to them?"
46,1,It's hard when something you rely on is gone.
46,2,"It's hard to let go, isn't it?"
46,3,I can't bear to part with them either.
46,4,It's hard to let go of something you love.
46,5,"You really love them, don't you?"
46,6,"Oh no, what happened?"
46,7,"Oh no, that’s awful!"
46,8,"Oh no, I can feel your pain!"
47,0,"I know, it's going to be hard."
47,1,I'm going to miss you so much.
47,2,I'm really going to miss our routine.
47,3,I’m really going to miss that.
47,4,I'm really going to miss that.
47,5,"It just won't be the same, will it?"
47,6,"I know, it's going to be a big change."
47,7,"I know, it’s going to be different."
47,8,Hi.
47,9,"It's going to be different, isn't it?"
47,10,"It's going to be an adjustment, for sure."
47,11,"Oh, wow."
47,12,I think she was pretty bummed.
47,13,That's gotta be a relief.
48,0,"Thanks so much, I really appreciate it."
48,1,"I understand, it's easier to ask someone in person."
48,2,I just feel so overwhelmed right now.
48,3,Sounds like a plan!
48,4,That sounds exciting!
48,5,That's great!
48,6,That's the spirit!
49,0,Hello there.
49,1,How are you doing today?
49,2,"It's late, isn't it?"
49,3,"Oh, wow, that's late."
49,4,"Oh no, that's not good."
49,5,"Oh yeah, I guess you're right."
49,6,"Sounds like a plan, enjoy the morning!"
49,7,I'm excited for you!
49,8,"It's a nice feeling, isn't it?"
49,9,"Hey, are you okay?"

49,16,"I know, it's a big decision."

52,1,"I know, I know."
52,2,"Oh, that sounds really stressful."
52,3,"Yeah, it's a lot to deal with."
52,4,"Oh, that's really thoughtful of you."
52,5,"I know, it’s complicated."
52,6,That must be a lot to think about.
52,7,"I just think it’s a lot to think about, you know?"
52,8,"Wow, that's a lot to think about."
52,9,"I know, it's a lot to process."
52,10,I can see how this would be a lot to process.
52,11,"I'm sorry, man."
53,0,"Oh my goodness, you must be so excited!"
53,1,"Oh, you're so excited!"
53,2,"Oh wow, you must be so excited!"
53,3,I'm so glad you like it!
53,4,I can tell you're really excited about this.
53,5,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
53,6,"I'm so sorry, that must be disappointing."
53,7,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize things were so complicated."
53,8,I didn't mean it like that!
53,9,That's actually a really good idea!
53,10,I'm so glad we're thinking of ways to cheer her up!
53,11,That's a fantastic idea!
53,12,I'm so glad we're making this a little less awful!
54,0,"Yes, it's a really difficult thing to go through."
54,1,"Alright, I understand this must be a difficult time for both of you."
54,2,It's incredibly difficult to go through something like this.
54,3,I understand this is difficult.
54,4,I understand this must be difficult to hear.
54,5,I understand this is a lot to take in.
54,6,"I am so sorry, this must be a lot to take in."
54,7,I understand this is a lot to process.
54,8,This is so unfair.
54,9,"Oh, this is all coming out now, isn't it?"
54,10,I understand this is difficult to hear.
54,11,"I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly difficult."
55,0,"I hear you, it's about more than just being alone."
55,1,It's frustrating when people make assumptions like that.
55,2,"Oh, honey, I hear you."
56,0,It must be so incredibly painful to be in this situation.
56,1,"It's just so hard, isn't it?"
56,2,"It really is, isn't it?"
56,3,"Yes, I see it too."
56,4,I understand how much that must hurt.
56,5,I just want to see my baby.
56,6,"It's hard, isn't it?"
56,7,I just want to hold my baby.
56,8,You're welcome.
56,9,I feel so much better.
56,10,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
56,11,I'm so happy for us.
57,0,I understand.
57,1,"That sounds like a fun, intimate idea."
57,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
57,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."
57,4,I love you too.
57,5,I am so sorry.
58,0,Hey there! How are you feeling?
58,1,How are you doing?
58,2,"Oh, wow."
58,3,I'm sorry you feel that way.
58,4,I'm not sure I'm in the mood for that.
58,5,Oh.
58,6,I'm sorry to hear that.
58,7,I'm sorry.
58,8,That must be a lot to navigate.
58,9,"Yeah, I get that it's complicated."
58,10,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
58,11,"I'm fine, just a little lost in thought."
58,12,"I'm doing okay, but I hear you."
58,13,"Oh wow, that sounds…intense."
58,14,It must feel complicated.
58,15,I think I'm good.
58,16,I'm here if you need to talk.
59,0,I'm glad you think so.
59,1,It's frustrating when things don't quite turn out right.
59,2,"It's okay, I understand how that could be frustrating."
60,0,That would be really difficult to face.
60,1,I know it's hard not to worry about the future.
60,2,I know it's hard to be optimistic right now.
60,3,"I know, it's scary to think about."
60,4,It sounds like you're really anxious about the procedures.
60,5,"I know, it's not exactly the most romantic setting, is it?"
60,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make light of it."
61,0,"Oh wow, that must have been mortifying."
61,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds awkward."
61,2,It sounds like you're feeling a bit put on the spot.
62,0,I understand.
62,1,I'm sorry to hear that.
63,0,Hey.
63,1,How are you doing?
64,0,I'm so sorry; I didn't realize I'd hurt you so much.
64,1,That sounds like a really frustrating situation.
64,2,That must feel incredibly frustrating.
64,3,I'm just really disappointed in you right now.
64,4,I'm sorry you're feeling so betrayed right now.
64,5,I just feel so betrayed right now.
64,6,I can't believe you're actually agreeing with me.
64,7,I appreciate that.
64,8,"That's really tough, having to cut back like that."
64,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I can."
64,10,It sounds like you're feeling a little lost right now.
64,11,That must have been exciting!
64,12,It must be a tough transition to make.
64,13,"It's a tough decision, I know."
64,14,"I can see that’s tempting, but it’s not an easy decision."
64,15,"I just, I don't know if I could."
64,16,"Sure, go ahead."
65,0,That must feel like a very fundamental loss.
65,1,I don't know.
65,2,"Clint, huh?"
65,3,"I get that, it's a tough name to live up to."
65,4,I'm just trying to find a name that suits you.
65,5,"That's a little... disappointing, isn't it?"
65,6,"Wow, you're really attached to that name."
65,7,"Ugh, fine."
65,8,"Oh man, that must be frustrating."
65,9,"It's okay, I get it."
65,10,"It's okay, I get it, names can be important."
66,0,It's good to be here.
66,1,"It was a long one, but I'm glad to be here."
66,2,That's wonderful to hear!
66,3,"I did, thanks."
66,4,I'm so glad to hear that!
67,0,What's wrong?
67,1,That sounds like a really frustrating situation.
67,2,That sounds frustrating.
67,3,"It's alright, I get it."
68,0,I understand your frustration.
68,1,"I just want to understand, that's all."
68,2,"I know, but it's still a lot to take in."
68,3,I'm just trying to understand why you're so upset.
68,4,"Oh, Rach..."
68,5,"This is a big deal, isn't it?"
68,6,I'm just so shocked.
68,7,I'm sure it's hard to imagine.
68,8,This is so weird.
68,9,I don't know.
68,10,"This is so frustrating, isn't it?"
68,11,"I'm sorry, I really wish I did."
68,12,What?
68,13,"You're really worried about this, aren't you?"
68,14,"Oh, Joey..."
69,0,I understand your frustration; it's tough seeing your friend suffer.
69,1,I understand your frustration; it's tough waiting when you're worried.
69,2,I understand your frustration; waiting that long is tough.
69,3,I'm just really worried about them.
69,4,"I know, and I'm sorry."
69,5,"I'm so sorry, I can only imagine how painful that must be."
70,0,I can imagine it's frustrating when others don't recognize that.
70,1,"Well, I went to a pretty prestigious school in New York."
70,2,That must have been a different kind of challenge.
70,3,"I took some classes in New York, but..."
70,4,"I see, it's frustrating when people don't take your passion seriously."
70,5,"Of course, I understand."
70,6,"Okay, thanks, I appreciate that."
70,7,You're welcome.
70,8,It's frustrating when things don't go the way you want them to.
70,9,I can tell you're really angry right now.
70,10,That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.
70,11,I can see why you'd feel that way.
70,12,It sounds like you're feeling really vulnerable right now.
70,13,I can see why you would feel that way.
70,14,That must feel really frustrating.
70,15,I can see how difficult that must be.
70,16,I know that feeling all too well.
70,17,"I understand, it's a difficult thing to face."
70,18,I know how much it hurts.
70,19,I'm so happy you're here.
70,20,"Oh, Tabatha, it's so good to see you!"
70,21,I'm happy for you both.
70,22,"Wow, that's a lot to process."
71,0,"Oh, that sounds really interesting!"
71,1,That's neat!
71,2,That's amazing!
71,3,"Oh, that's too bad."
71,4,"I understand, it can be tough."
71,5,"I know, it can be tough."
71,6,"It is awkward, isn't it?"
71,7,"I know, it can be tough."
71,8,"It's okay, I know this can be difficult."
71,9,"I get it, that can be a little nerve-wracking."
71,10,I can see you're feeling confident.
71,11,It sounds like you're feeling relieved.
71,12,That sounds like a relief.
71,13,"Wow, that must have been a pretty big relief!"
72,0,"Oh, that's wonderful news!"
72,1,Great!
72,2,What's wrong?
72,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
72,4,I'm really not okay with this.
72,5,That sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening.
72,6,I understand how frustrating this must be.
72,7,I understand your frustration; it must be incredibly difficult.
72,8,I understand how frustrating this must be.
72,9,I understand how frustrating this must be.
72,10,I understand how frustrating this must be.
72,11,This must be so frustrating for you.
72,12,"Oh honey, I am so sorry, this is awful."
72,13,"Oh, honey, I can only imagine how frustrating this is."
72,14,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, this must be incredibly frustrating."
72,15,"It’s just not fair, is it?"
72,16,You're in so much pain right now.
73,0,I can see why you'd be worried.
73,1,"You're feeling defensive, I can tell."
73,2,I guess that makes sense.
73,3,I understand you want to be friendly.
73,4,"Okay, I hope it goes well."
73,5,"Okay, just be careful, alright?"
73,6,I hope it goes well.
73,7,I can understand why you'd feel that way.
73,8,"It's okay, I get it."
73,9,I can see that this is frustrating.
73,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and confused.
74,0,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't being supportive."
74,1,"I appreciate that, thank you."
74,2,I understand it feels like we're not backing you.
74,3,I feel like you're not really taking me seriously.
74,4,That's a lot to process all at once.
75,0,"Of course, I'm happy to be here."
75,1,I'm glad we could connect.
75,2,Thank you for offering me a seat.
75,3,I'm a little nervous.
75,4,I'm ready.
75,5,"Oh, wow, okay."
76,0,"Oh, that must have felt great!"
76,1,"Hi Monica, it's nice to meet you."
76,2,"Hey there, Paolo."
76,3,"Hello, Joey."
76,4,"So, Paolo, what do you think of all of us?"
76,5,Hi!
76,6,It's nice to meet you all.
76,7,"Oh, that must be difficult."
76,8,"It's okay, I understand."
76,9,It looks like he's from Italy.
76,10,"Oh, that must be exciting!"
76,11,It must be strange to have someone new just appear like that.
76,12,That must have been quite a surprise.
76,13,"Oh, honey."
76,14,"It's a little unsettling, isn't it?"
76,15,That must have been a surprise.
76,16,I can see why you'd feel a bit left out.
76,17,"Oh, wow, so you're just meeting him now?"
76,18,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
77,0,I'm not sure I understand.
77,1,"Oh, honey..."
77,2,I can see why you'd be upset.
77,3,You really want to do this?
77,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were hungry."
78,0,Because it hurts.
78,1,"Oh, I see... that must be disappointing."
78,2,"I know, I'm sorry."
78,3,"It's okay, you sound tired."
78,4,Hi.
78,5,What's on your mind?
78,6,What?
78,7,"Oh, wow, that's amazing!"
78,8,I'm so proud of you!
78,9,Congratulations!
79,0,I'm so excited!
79,1,Are you not excited?
80,0,I know this is incredibly upsetting.
80,1,I can't believe this is happening.
80,2,"I know, it's a lot to deal with right now."
80,3,I'm just so angry right now.
80,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
80,5,I can't believe you're saying that.
80,6,"I appreciate that, thanks, honey."
80,7,I'm just so worried about where we'll go.
80,8,"I know this is hard, but you can do this."
80,9,"Okay, just go talk to him, and we'll figure it out."
81,0,It's hard to believe someone wouldn't want something in return.
81,1,That sounds like a difficult trade-off.
82,0,"Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now."
83,0,"Oh, wow, that must feel like a huge loss."
83,1,"I’m so sorry, that must have been incredibly disorienting."
83,2,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot to process."
83,3,"Oh, that sounds incredibly overwhelming."
83,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds intense."
83,5,I can only imagine how that must feel right now.
83,6,I think I pulled a muscle in my back.
83,7,"Oh no, what could be worse?"
83,8,I think I might know what you're about to say.
83,9,"Oh, that’s rough."
83,10,That sounds incredibly frustrating and confusing.
84,0,I just feel so lost and confused right now.
84,1,You seem upset.
84,2,"Oh no, that sounds absolutely awful."
85,0,"I understand, it's still a worry though, right?"
85,1,I'm really worried for you.
85,2,"I understand, it's scary to think about going to the doctor."
85,3,"I understand, it's scary when something like that happens."
85,4,"It's frustrating when your body doesn't cooperate, especially after you've been working hard."
85,5,It's frustrating when things like this come up and mess with your plans.
86,0,"Oh, I see."
86,1,It sounds like there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.
86,2,"That sounds like a lot of work, and a labor of love."
86,3,"Oh, honey."
86,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a disaster."
86,5,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
86,6,"Oh, honey."
86,7,"It's okay, I understand."
87,0,"Oh, I get what you mean."
87,1,"Oh, wow..."
88,0,I'm so excited to be here!
88,1,"I know, it's exciting, isn't it?"
88,2,"I know, it can be a lot sometimes."
88,3,"I know, it's hard when you don't want to watch something."
88,4,"I know, it's hard to resist, isn't it?"
88,5,"I know, it's so frustrating when you just want a simple glass of milk."
88,6,It is so frustrating when you just want a simple glass of milk.
88,7,"I know, it's so frustrating!"
88,8,"I know, it's frustrating when you just want a simple glass of milk."
88,9,"I understand, it can be frustrating when you don't want to watch something."
88,10,"I can feel your frustration, Kevin."
88,11,I can see why you'd be intrigued!
88,12,I can feel your excitement!
88,13,I can't believe how excited you are!
89,0,I'm ready.
89,1,That's really convenient.
89,2,I'm so happy for you!
90,0,That must be incredibly difficult to hear.
90,1,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly difficult to process."
90,2,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly painful."
90,3,Thank you.
90,4,I'm so sorry you're hurting so much right now.
90,5,I can only imagine how much that hurts.
91,0,"Sure, here you go."
92,0,"Me neither, I'm so excited!"
92,1,That sounds like a plan!
92,2,That sounds like a stressful situation.
92,3,"Oh, honey, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
92,4,"Oh, you're sweet."
92,5,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you angry."
93,0,That sounds incredibly stressful.
93,1,I just feel so lost right now.
93,2,"I wish I could, but I can’t risk my job either."
93,3,"Oh man, this is really bad timing, huh?"
93,4,"I'm here for you, whatever it is."
93,8,What's up?
93,9,"I know, it’s a lot to take in."
93,10,"I'm not doing so well, to be honest."
93,11,"I'd do anything for you, man."
93,12,Because I'm your friend.
93,13,I understand you must feel really desperate right now.
93,14,I just need to get this mini-fridge past security.
93,15,"You're really hoping to impress her, aren't you?"
94,0,I understand that must have been a shock.
94,1,That must feel incredibly dehumanizing.
94,2,I'm not sure I want to be alone right now.
95,0,"Oh, wow, I can see how that would be disappointing."
95,1,"Oh, no problem, I'm glad I could help!"
95,2,"Yeah, I did."
95,3,"Oh wow, I am so sorry."
95,4,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it."
95,5,"I am so incredibly sorry, that is just so unfair."
95,6,I understand why you're feeling frustrated right now.
95,7,I can't believe you felt you had to do that.
95,8,It sounds like that was a tough decision to make.
95,9,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it would make you feel that way."
95,10,I feel like I'm stuck in a tough spot right now.
95,11,I think I might be a little bit hurt right now.
95,12,I just feel like you're not seeing my side.
95,13,That's a tough spot to be in.
95,14,I just wanted to make a good impression.
95,15,You seem a little hurt.
95,16,"Oh, hey Ross!"
95,17,"Oh, that's gotta sting."
95,18,I get why you'd feel a little left out right now.
95,19,"I'm sorry, that must feel really awkward."
96,0,"Of course, here you go."
96,1,"My skin is so dry, it's really uncomfortable."
96,2,"Oh wow, that's exciting!"
96,3,I promise I won't.
96,4,"Of course, anything for you."
96,5,"He's right here, trying to calm down."
96,6,"Oh, honey, I get it."
96,7,"Oh honey, are you okay?"
96,8,I'm so sorry!
96,9,I'm so sorry!
96,10,Sounds like you're in a tough spot.
96,11,"Oh, that's so sweet of you!"
96,12,"Yeah, it was pretty magical."
96,13,"Oh, wow, that's a tight schedule."
96,14,"Yeah, I get that."
96,15,Sounds like you're in a tough spot right now.
96,16,"Yeah, I get that."
96,17,"Yeah, those moments can be pretty special."
96,18,Of course.
96,19,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
96,20,"Wow, you really are in a hurry."
97,0,Hey Joey!
97,1,"Of course I remember you, Monica!"
97,2,"That's so sweet, Joey!"
97,3,"It's pretty amazing, but also a lot of hard work, y'know?"
97,4,"It's pretty amazing, isn't it?"
97,5,"It's pretty cool, yeah."
97,6,"Wow, that must feel amazing."
97,7,"Oh, I bet you're dying to tell him!"
97,8,"What's wrong, Joey?"
97,9,"Oh, alright!"
97,10,"No problem, Joey."
97,11,You sound a little overwhelmed.
98,0,"It must be a little unsettling, though, right?"
98,1,That sounds really unsettling.
98,2,"It must be a little scary, too, with so much darkness."
98,3,"Yeah, I guess it's getting chilly."
98,4,Because it's going to get cold.
98,5,I guess it's pretty frustrating when you had plans.
98,6,"Oh honey, I know, it's frustrating when you're all dressed up."
98,7,I can see how you'd be worried.
98,8,"I'm sorry, I know you're worried."
98,9,I'm here for you.
98,10,"Of course, here's the number."
98,11,"Oh, you're worried about her, aren't you?"
99,0,"Just feeling a bit lost, to be honest."
99,1,Sounds refreshing.
99,2,She's gone.
99,3,"Oh, right."
99,4,"Yes, I'm sure."
99,5,I guess we could.
99,6,"Okay, let's do it."
99,7,"Oh, that's disappointing."
99,8,"Oh, you're feeling a little sad for the chick, aren't you?"
99,9,I'm so sorry.
100,0,It's just that I don't want to be a burden.
100,1,I'm glad you feel safe.
100,2,I do.
100,3,I'm glad you feel that way.
100,4,That sounds really nice.
100,5,"Hey, it's alright, no need to apologize."
100,6,"It's alright, I understand."
100,7,"It's okay, I understand."
100,8,"It's alright, I'm here."
100,9,It’s okay to feel a little overwhelmed.
100,10,"It's alright, accidents happen."
100,11,It's alright.
100,12,"Oh, honey."
100,13,You don't sound so good.
100,14,I guess it can be overwhelming.
100,15,"I don’t know, but I’m sure she’ll be okay."
100,16,"I'm sorry, I can't."
100,17,I'm here.
100,18,"You miss her, don't you?"
100,19,Leslie?
101,0,Hey!
101,1,What's on your mind?
101,2,I just feel so lost right now.
101,3,"Oh no, that sounds frustrating."
102,0,"I'm so sorry, that must have been really hurtful to hear."
102,1,That must have been a shock for you.
102,2,I understand why you're upset.
102,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit hurt.
102,4,I understand your frustration.
102,5,I just wanted to know everything.
102,6,I understand this must be frustrating.
102,7,"I know, it's frustrating when things don't go the way you expect."
102,8,"I don't think so, but I don't know her well."
102,9,"You're really worried about this, aren't you?"
103,0,Hey there.
103,1,What's wrong?
103,2,I'm here for you.
103,3,"No, it's about something else entirely."
103,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds tough."
103,5,"Yeah, it's been a while."
104,0,I'm not comfortable answering that.
104,1,"Okay, I understand."
104,2,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
105,0,Are you alright?
105,1,"You're alright, it's okay, I'm here."
105,2,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you!"
106,0,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
106,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
106,2,"I know, it's a tough habit to break."
106,3,I can imagine how upsetting that must be.
107,0,"Yes, what is it?"
107,1,I'm so nervous to ask.
107,2,"Yes, I do."
107,3,"Oh, I see."
107,4,Oh.
107,5,"Oh, that's a shame."
107,6,"Oh, wow, that must have been a while ago."
107,7,That must have been a long time ago.
107,8,That must have been a difficult time for you.
107,9,I'm just curious.
107,10,I'm curious to hear what you're thinking.
107,11,"Oh, honey..."
107,12,I guess I don't.
108,0,I hear you.
108,3,"I hear you, it feels like a real violation of trust."
108,4,"I get that, it's tempting when the deal is good."
108,5,"I hear you, money's tight."
108,6,"Wow, that looks so comfy!"
108,7,"Oh, honey, I get it."
108,8,I can see why you're so excited!
108,9,"That's really sweet of you, Phoebe."
109,0,That's a pretty neat party trick!
109,1,Just quarters.
109,2,"Oh, wow."
109,3,That must have been a really tough thing to do.
109,4,"Yeah, I'm sure."
109,5,I'm sensing a bit of playful darkness there.
109,6,I understand that can be difficult to accept.
109,7,I'm not sure I like the sound of this.
110,0,I can't believe she would do that.
110,1,"Oh, so you're feeling a bit insecure right now."
110,2,That sounds incredibly nerve-wracking.
110,3,I can't believe she would do that.
110,4,I can understand why you're feeling so excited.
110,5,That sounds really special.
110,6,It sounds like you're really looking forward to this.
110,7,That sounds like a really good plan.
110,8,It sounds like you're feeling a little nervous about this.
111,0,"No, thank you, but it's really kind of you to think of me."
111,1,That means a lot to me.
111,2,I love you too.
111,3,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
111,4,"It's alright, I get it, it's just a lot to process."
111,5,"I know, I know."
111,6,"I'm sorry, I know it must be hard to hear."
111,7,I can only imagine how confusing that must be.
111,8,"I know, it's just that I feel so… hurt."
111,9,"Yes, we're okay."
111,10,It's okay if you need some time.
111,11,"I know, I know, this is all a lot to take in."
111,12,"Oh, wow."
111,13,"I know, right?"
111,14,Wow.
112,0,What's wrong?
112,1,"Oh, is it something special?"
112,2,"That's really frustrating, I'm sorry."
112,3,"Wow, that sounds really frustrating."
112,4,"I know, it's like they're everywhere."
112,5,"I'm so sorry, that's awful."
112,6,That really stinks.
112,7,I understand; it's incredibly frustrating.
112,8,I really appreciate you saying that.
112,9,I know we will.
112,10,I wouldn't have it any other way.
112,11,It's like a crime scene.
112,12,Wow.
112,13,"Oh, my God."
112,14,Thank you.
112,15,"Well, I'm sorry you have to go through this."
112,16,I've always felt like everything happens for a reason.
112,17,"Well, I'm glad someone is."
112,18,I would love that.
112,19,Great! I'll wait.
112,20,Sure.
112,21,"Well, that’s a shame."
113,0,"I know, I'm just really frustrated right now."
113,1,"I'm just trying to have some fun, okay?"
113,2,"I can't believe it, that's a long time."
113,3,"Alright, come on in, the water's fine."
113,4,"Okay, I can see you're really invested in this."
113,5,"I'm sorry, what's wrong?"
113,6,"Oh, no, that's frustrating."
113,7,I know it's frustrating to have a dropper on your team.
113,8,I can see why you'd be upset.
113,9,I understand that can be frustrating.
113,10,I can see how that would be frustrating.
113,11,You sound frustrated.
113,12,"I know, it can be frustrating when things get tough."
113,13,"You're getting pretty frustrated, huh?"
113,14,That sounds pretty frustrating.
113,15,"It's okay, you're frustrated, I get it."
113,16,"It's just not working out, is it?"
114,0,"Oh, that's frustrating, I'm sorry."
114,1,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't think so."
114,2,"I know, it's a lot, but you sounded so stressed."
114,3,"I'm just... overwhelmed, Joey."
114,4,I was just trying to help.
114,5,"I don't think I'm ready to pick a day, Joey."
115,0,That sounds like a very important order!
115,1,I know it's frustrating when you feel like you're not good at something.
115,2,"Oh, come on, don't get your feathers ruffled."
115,3,I guess it wasn't your best moment.
115,4,"You seem really invested in this, Chandler."
115,5,You think you can really pull it off?
116,0,That must make it difficult to stay connected.
116,1,It's got to be tough not knowing.
116,2,It's gotta be frustrating when you feel like you're not being heard.
116,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
116,4,"I'm sorry, this is obviously hard for you."
116,5,"Yeah, you too."
116,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit dismissed.
116,7,I can see you're really passionate about this.
116,8,I can see you're really passionate about this.
116,9,I can see you're really passionate about this.
116,10,I can tell you're really passionate about this.
116,11,I can see this is frustrating you.
117,0,"Thank you for the reminder, I appreciate it."
117,1,I'm glad you enjoyed it.
117,2,"Yeah, I'm glad you enjoyed it."
117,3,I appreciate you being here.
117,4,"Sure, what's up?"
117,5,"That move can be a little unsettling, can't it?"
117,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds really scary."
117,7,I understand that can be a bit overwhelming to think about.
117,8,"Yeah, I’m just saying, what if you were me?"
118,0,"I understand, it's never easy to be in this position."
118,1,"It's okay, I understand."
118,2,I just want you to be happy.
118,3,I...I just don't know what to say.
118,4,"I understand, it’s okay to feel that way."
118,5,It’s okay to feel that way.
118,6,Tell me.
118,7,"Just, can you promise to stay?"
118,8,Tell me about him.
118,9,"Wow, that's a lot to process, I can see why this is difficult."
118,10,"Yes, I think so."
118,11,"Okay, bye."
119,0,You sound really determined.
119,1,"Oh, wow, that must be a little embarrassing."
119,2,"Oh, wow, that must be tough."
119,3,"I know, it's frustrating when someone's not as skilled."
119,4,"Oh, wow, that sounds really tough."
119,5,I understand.
119,6,That sounds like a lot of pressure.
120,0,I appreciate that.
120,1,That sounds lovely!
120,2,That sounds so lovely and inviting.
120,3,That sounds like a wonderful idea!
120,4,It sounds like you're feeling a little overwhelmed by the details.
120,5,I'm glad you do.
120,6,I can tell you're feeling a bit defensive.
120,7,"Oh, that sounds like a big change from the guest room idea."
120,8,It sounds like you're a bit unsure about this idea.
120,9,I can tell you're feeling pretty strongly about this.
120,10,"I'm sorry, I just don't think it would work."
120,11,It sounds like you're feeling a little deflated.
120,12,I guess I just really don’t want a game room.
120,13,I see.
120,14,I'm sensing a bit of disappointment there.
120,15,I didn't realize I was coming across so negatively.
120,16,I guess it’s just that I like the idea of a beautiful guest room.
120,17,"No, I'm not."
120,18,"I'm just a little disappointed, that's all."
121,0,"Me too, it's one of my favorite things."
121,1,I'm so glad we have these moments together.
121,2,"Oh, I think I know what it is!"
121,3,You're a genius!
121,4,I love you too.
121,5,I feel so loved right now.
122,0,"Oh, so you were trying to protect me?"
122,1,Because I was afraid of how you'd react.
122,2,It's okay not to know.
122,3,I'm glad you're excited!
122,4,That's exciting!
123,0,"Oh no, what happened?"
123,1,But he still let you down.
123,2,"Oh, wow, that must feel like a real betrayal."
123,3,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating when things don't work out."
123,4,Because it will just make you feel worse.
123,5,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to deal with all at once."
123,6,"I know, it’s awful when things aren’t what they seem."
123,7,He just broke up with you?
123,8,I’m so sorry; this is a lot to deal with right now.
123,9,"Ugh, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
123,10,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
123,11,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to handle all at once."
123,12,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
123,13,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
123,14,I hear the frustration in your voice.
123,15,"Oh, wow, that's a tough call."
124,0,"Oh no, are you going to miss your flight?"
124,1,Safe travels.
124,2,"I have no idea, and that's what scares me the most."
124,3,That sounds like a long and difficult journey.
124,4,It's going to be so hard to be apart.
124,5,Goodbye.
124,6,I'll miss you so much.
124,7,I'll miss you too.
124,8,I'm so sorry.
124,9,I'll never forget you.
124,10,I'm so glad.
124,11,It's so good to see you.
124,12,I'm so sorry.
124,13,"Oh, honey, I can't believe you're doing this for me."
124,14,"Oh, Janice, I don't know what to say."
125,0,Hello there.
125,1,How are you doing?
125,2,"She's really struggling, actually."
125,3,That's great to hear!
125,4,"She seemed very pleased, yes."
125,5,That's wonderful to hear.
125,6,I'm here.
125,7,How are you feeling today?
125,8,"Sure, take your time."
125,9,"Oh, that sounds stressful."
125,10,"Of course, take your time."
125,11,"Oh no, what’s wrong?"
125,12,That sounds like a lot to manage at once.
125,13,"Oh no, that's terrible news."
125,14,"Oh, wow, that's terrible."
125,15,That’s… a lot to process.
125,16,That's a lot to process.
125,17,I'm so sorry.
125,18,I can't believe this is happening.
125,19,I know how much that show meant to you.
125,20,"I know, it's just… a lot to take in."
125,21,"No, don't be."
125,22,"I know, it's just…wow."
126,0,I can see why you'd feel that way.
126,1,"Me too, it's peaceful."
126,2,No need to apologize; I understand.
126,3,"No, I was just thinking about something else."
126,4,"Of course, I will."
126,5,I’m really scared right now.
126,6,"It's okay, I'll go check."
126,7,Okay.
126,8,"I'm coming, I'm coming."
126,9,You seem really scared.
126,10,"Oh, honey."
126,11,You feel betrayed.
126,12,"I'm so sorry, I didn't know."
126,13,"Oh, thank you."
126,14,"You're welcome, sweetie."
126,15,I'm so glad you're feeling better.
127,0,"I know, it was awful."
127,1,That must have been quite jarring.
127,2,I understand that might be confusing.
127,3,I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about that.
127,4,"I’m sorry, that must have been unsettling."
127,5,"I understand, and I appreciate you looking out for us."
128,0,"Just staring out the window, feeling a bit lost."
128,1,"Leaning is a very important activity, isn't it?"
128,2,"It helps, doesn't it?"
128,3,"Oh no, are you scared?"
128,4,Oh no! Are you okay?
128,5,"Oh my goodness, are you serious?"
128,6,You seem really worried.
128,7,I think I do.
128,8,I understand this must be incredibly difficult for you.
128,9,I am so sorry you are going through this.
129,0,"Okay, I'm ready."
129,1,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
129,2,"I understand, it's frustrating when things don't go as planned."
129,3,It's frustrating when you're not getting what you need.
129,4,It's frustrating when you're not getting what you need.
129,5,"Okay, I understand."
129,6,"I can feel the pressure, but we've got this!"
129,7,I'm not sure I can do that.
130,0,"I don't know yet, and I'm really anxious to find out."
130,1,It sounds like you're really hoping he won't come.
130,2,I just don't want to deal with the fallout if he's offended.
130,3,I see you're worried about the presentation.
130,4,I'm so glad you think so.
130,5,You sound a little unsure.
130,6,"It’s hard to know who to include, isn't it?"
130,7,"Oh, that's nice of you."
130,8,"Yeah, I know she's been having a rough time."
130,9,That must have been a tough call.
130,10,That sounds really difficult.
130,11,I can see why you're feeling conflicted.
130,12,I can imagine that would be a difficult situation.
130,13,"I understand, it's a tough call."
130,14,"That would be lovely, thanks."
130,15,It sounds like you're really trying to be considerate of my feelings.
130,16,"That sounds lovely, thanks."
130,17,I can see this is a difficult decision.
131,0,Hi there.
131,1,How are you doing today?
131,2,"Not great, honestly."
131,3,That's wonderful to hear!
131,4,I'm so relieved to hear that.
131,5,"I'm so sorry, that must have been a shock."
131,6,"Oh, wow, that must have been a lot to take in."
131,7,"I'm so sorry, that must be disappointing."
131,8,"Oh honey, I am so sorry."
132,0,"Of course, I'd be glad to."
132,1,"Of course, I can help you find them."
132,2,"Oh, that must be a difficult situation to deal with."
132,3,I'm worried about him.
132,4,I can look that up for you.
132,5,"Oh, I understand that must be frustrating."
132,6,"I understand your frustration, but I still can't give you that information."
132,7,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand."
132,8,"I understand, but I can't give out that information."
132,9,"Look, I can see you’re trying to help someone."
132,10,I understand you're feeling incredibly stressed and worried right now.
132,11,I understand this is urgent and you're feeling desperate.
132,12,I understand this is a stressful situation.
132,13,I understand this must be incredibly frustrating for you.
132,14,I understand how frustrating this must be.
132,15,Thank you so much.
132,16,You're welcome.
132,17,You're welcome.
132,18,I understand this is important to you.
132,19,"I understand your concern, but I can't provide that information."
133,0,Hello there!
133,1,How are you doing today?
133,2,"Oh no, that sounds really painful!"
133,3,"It really stings, doesn't it?"
133,4,You're very welcome.
133,5,I'm glad I could help.
133,6,"Okay, sounds good."
133,7,See you soon.
133,8,What's wrong?
133,9,What is it?
133,10,Bye.
133,11,"I'm here for you, what's wrong?"
133,12,"Oh, honey."
133,13,I'm so sorry.
133,14,"Oh, honey."
133,15,Oh honey.
134,0,I just feel so lost right now.
134,1,"Oh no, I'm so sorry."
134,2,I know you're disappointed.
134,3,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
135,0,"Oh no, that's terrible!"
135,1,"Yes, really."
135,2,"Of course, I'll call him right away."
135,3,"Okay, great!"
135,4,"Oh, that's so kind of you!"
135,5,That's great to hear!
136,0,I'm so glad you like it!
137,0,It's a tough spot to be in.
137,1,It's a tough spot to be in.
137,2,I get that feeling.
137,3,It's a mountain of nachos.
137,4,"No, but I am intrigued."
137,5,"Just sitting here, eating this cake."
137,6,"It's okay, you don't have to tell me."
137,7,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted right now."
137,8,Are you okay?
137,9,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to take in."
137,10,"Yeah, that's rough."
137,11,"Oh, wow, that’s…a lot to process."
137,12,"Wow, that's gotta sting."
137,13,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
137,14,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
138,0,"I'm not sure, I can't remember."
138,1,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you say that."
138,2,"Oh no, that sounds mortifying."
138,3,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
139,0,I can't believe it!
139,1,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
139,2,I'm sorry you feel that way.
139,3,Hi!
139,4,I can't believe you're here.
139,5,Hey!
139,6,I'm so glad we're here together.
139,7,Right here.
139,8,It's not weird?
139,9,"Okay, that’s good."
140,0,I understand how disappointing that must be.
140,1,"Yeah, it's a real gut punch when you feel so connected to something and it doesn't work out."
140,2,What's that?
140,3,"I know you're frustrated, and it's okay to feel that way."
140,4,"That's a great idea, but it's okay if you're feeling down right now."
140,5,"That sounds like a lot of work, but also really exciting."
140,6,"That's a big leap, isn't it?"
140,7,It's frustrating when things don't go as planned.
140,8,That's a really tough thing to consider.
140,9,"That's a great idea, but I don't know if I'm ready for that."
140,10,That's a thought!
140,11,"It's okay, we could figure it out together."
140,12,It's frustrating when you feel like something is out of reach.
140,13,It's okay to feel that way.
140,14,That's really kind of you.
140,15,I really appreciate that.
140,16,That sounds like a good plan.
141,0,I mostly shoot landscapes and wildlife.
141,1,"Oh, that sounds exciting!"
141,2,I can imagine that's a little frustrating.
141,3,"Wow, that's really generous of you."
141,4,"Wow, that must be a unique situation."
142,0,"That sounds exciting, but also a little nerve-wracking."
142,1,I can tell you're feeling a bit hopeful right now.
143,0,"That sounds like a really big step, and I'm proud of you."
143,1,"That's a fair point, but it's not always easy."
143,2,"I understand, it's tough when you want to change but also feel stuck."
143,3,What is it?
143,4,What are you feeling right now?
143,5,"Oh, honey, that sounds like a really scary thought."
143,6,"I'm sorry, that's a really painful thing to worry about."
143,7,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was a fear of yours."
143,8,"Oh wow, that's a lot to take in."
144,0,"Oh, it sounds incredibly frustrating."
144,1,"Oh, it sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated."
144,2,I understand.
144,3,"I know, it’s hard, but please, just try."
144,4,I understand it must be difficult to feel so hurt.
144,5,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating."
144,6,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
144,7,I understand it's difficult to face her.
144,8,"Oh, Monica, that must feel incredibly hurtful."
144,9,"I'm so sorry, that must feel really hurtful."
144,10,That must have stung.
144,11,"I know, it feels awful when you're left out."
144,12,I can see you're really hurting.
144,13,I'm so sorry.
144,14,You think you’re not wanted?
145,0,"We're just feeling really down, you know?"
145,1,"Just browsing, I guess."
145,2,"Oh no, what happened?"
145,3,I'm so sorry to hear that.
145,4,"Oh, Chandler, that's so sweet."
145,5,"I'm feeling the same way, actually."
145,6,"Oh, wow, that's a big step."
145,7,"I'm here for you, buddy."
145,8,I'm glad you're being open with me.
145,9,It sounds like you're really nervous about this.
145,10,I can see that you're really torn up about this.
145,11,I can see why you're feeling that way.
145,12,It sounds like you're really wrestling with a big decision.
146,0,"Oh, that's really thoughtful of you."
146,1,"Oh no, that's awful, I'm so sorry to hear that."
146,2,"I know, I was really looking forward to that too."
146,3,"Oh, that sounds really stressful for everyone."
146,4,"I know, it's so frustrating when things fall apart like that."
146,5,"Wow, that’s a lot to process."
146,6,"Yeah, I can imagine that's a relief."
147,0,That must feel incredibly frustrating.
147,1,"I'm so bummed, too."
147,2,"I know, it's late, but I'm really not ready for this to end."
147,3,"I understand the frustration, it's late."
147,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was so late."
147,5,I can tell you're feeling really frustrated right now.
147,6,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
147,7,"Okay, I understand."
147,8,"Okay, I understand."
147,9,I'm just so tired.
147,10,I can see you're really disappointed.
148,0,It's okay.
149,0,I don't want to leave either.
149,1,I understand.
149,2,I'm so sorry.
150,0,"I know, it feels like everyone's watching."
150,1,"Oh, sweetheart, I can see you're hurting so much."
150,2,"I understand, it feels like everything is too much right now."
150,3,"I’m sorry, I should have known."
150,4,I don't want you to go.
150,5,"I’m really sorry, honey."
151,0,What's wrong?
151,1,There's something gross on the floor?
151,2,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were upset."
151,3,"No, I can't."
152,0,That must feel like a really special connection.
152,1,"Yeah, it feels like a betrayal, doesn't it?"
152,2,"Oh wow, so you feel like you've both inherited something special?"
152,3,I'm so sorry.
152,4,That must be so disappointing.
153,0,That must feel incredibly freeing.
153,1,I understand this might feel a little daunting.
153,2,That sounds... lonely.
153,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit apprehensive about this.
153,4,That sounds incredibly daunting.
153,5,That sounds incredibly difficult.
153,6,It's tough to just jump into something when you're scared.
153,7,That sounds incredibly daunting.
153,8,I'm glad I could help.
153,9,"Yeah, I do."
153,10,"Wow, you really are feeling brave right now."
153,11,I can understand why that would be terrifying.
154,0,Hey! What's wrong?
154,1,I'm glad you're here.
154,2,"Oh, wow, that's so exciting!"
154,3,"Oh wow, I'd love to!"
154,4,"Oh, I understand, that's a shame."
154,5,"Oh no, I don't know."
154,6,"Oh no, I'm so sorry, that's awful."
154,7,"I am so sorry, that is awful."
154,8,"I am so sorry, that's awful."
154,9,I'm sorry that happened.
154,10,"I'm sorry, that's awful."
154,11,"I'm so sorry, that must have been really upsetting."
154,12,It really does capture the magic of the moment.
154,13,"It's so easy to let those things slide, isn't it?"
154,14,I'd love that.
154,15,"Yeah, I think that would be really special."
154,16,That actually sounds really nice.
154,17,That sounds really fun.
154,18,"Yeah, definitely."
154,19,Bye.
154,20,Bye!
155,0,That sounds really tough.
155,1,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
155,2,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
155,3,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
155,4,I just feel so trapped right now.
155,5,"I’m sorry, I didn't mean for things to get this bad."
155,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that."
155,7,Okay.
155,8,I’m sorry.
156,0,That's wonderful news!
156,1,"Oh no, that's such a bummer."
156,2,"I'm sorry, I know you were looking forward to it."
156,3,"I understand, that must be frustrating."
156,4,She's feeling a little under the weather.
156,5,"Oh, that’s… disappointing."
156,6,"I'm so sorry, this must be frustrating."
156,7,"I can't help but feel a bit uneasy about this, to be honest."
156,8,"I'm sorry, I don't know, I really don't."
156,9,"Oh, Bing, I am so sorry."
156,10,I feel so lost right now.
156,11,"Oh Bing, I'm so sorry."
156,12,Please don’t say that.
156,13,"I appreciate that, I really do."
156,14,I could really use a friend right now.
156,15,"I know, right?"
157,0,It must be so heartwarming to see them like that.
157,1,You love her so much.
157,2,"Oh my god, are you serious right now?"
157,3,"Oh, Rachel, you sound really stressed."
157,4,I'm just trying to make sure everyone is safe.
157,5,"Oh, that's really thoughtful of you."
157,6,"You go, I'll keep watch."
157,7,I'm here.
158,0,"No, he didn't."
158,1,I was really hoping he would.
158,2,I know how much you were looking forward to his call.
158,3,It's okay to feel frustrated and disappointed.
158,4,I know it's incredibly frustrating when someone doesn't follow through on their word.
158,5,I know how frustrating that must feel.
158,6,"It’s just a guess, I don’t know."
159,0,"No, I didn't, and I'm so sorry this is happening."
159,1,I just don't want you to feel bad about this.
160,0,"Yes, it's awful when you hurt someone you care about."
160,1,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated.
160,2,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt right now.
160,3,I can see why you'd feel that way.
160,4,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt right now.
160,5,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt right now.
160,6,It sounds like you're really feeling hurt and a bit left out.
160,7,It sounds like you're feeling really hurt right now.
160,8,"Oh, so you feel like you're missing out?"
160,9,"You feel like you're being excluded, don't you?"
160,10,I can see how that would make you feel left out.
160,11,"I know, it feels like something really important is ending."
160,12,"I get how that feels, it's like a part of your life is ending."
160,13,"You're feeling a bit left out, aren't you?"
161,0,I understand your frustration with the pace.
161,1,"Oh no, what happened?"
161,2,"Oh wow, that's a lot to process."
161,3,"Wow, that's a lot to process."
161,4,"Thanks, I'm really happy."
161,5,"Thanks, I'll need it."
161,6,Is everything okay?
161,7,Are you okay?
161,8,I can see you're excited to see her.
161,9,"Wow, that's a huge question to be asked."
161,10,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
161,11,"That's wonderful, I'm so happy for you!"
162,0,"Oh no, are you alright?"
162,1,Do you need some help?
162,2,"Oh no, that's frustrating!"
162,3,"Oh, I see."
162,4,I understand.
162,5,"Oh no, I really hope I didn't!"
163,0,"Maybe they were just overwhelmed, too."
163,1,I was expecting a tear or two.
163,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
163,3,"It really was a special day, wasn't it?"
163,4,"It was a really touching moment, wasn't it?"
163,5,"It really does make you miss them, doesn't it?"
163,6,It really does feel like a piece of them was missing.
163,7,"I know, it's hard when you're missing someone."
163,8,I can't believe she missed it.
163,9,I guess I'm just a sentimental sap.
164,0,It's easy to overlook the classics sometimes.
164,1,"They really did have a lot of hits, didn't they?"
164,2,That's so cool!
164,3,That's a pretty special memory.
164,4,"It's okay, sometimes jokes just take a minute to land."
164,5,"Oh, honey, I can see how that would be confusing."
164,6,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow."
164,7,I’m sorry; I didn't mean to offend.
164,8,"Wow, that's a lot of money!"
165,0,"Ugh, that's so frustrating."
165,1,I just don't know where to look.
165,2,"They're right here, I can grab them for you."
165,3,That sounds really frustrating.
165,4,"I know, it's so frustrating."
166,0,I know it must be incredibly difficult to have that conversation.
166,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly awkward and confusing."
166,2,I just… I don’t know what to do.
166,3,"Oh, honey, that must have been so awkward and confusing."
166,4,"I know this is really hard, but you can do this."
166,5,I understand; it's tough when you care about someone.
166,6,"I know it's hard, but you have to be honest with her."
166,7,You’re going to be okay.
166,8,"It's really hard to know what to do, isn't it?"
166,9,"You got this, Joey."
166,10,"I know this is hard, but you can do it."
166,11,You are.
166,12,What?
166,13,"Oh, Joey."
167,0,That sounds incredibly bleak.
167,1,Which is what I find so difficult to get into.
167,2,"Oh, wow, that's a tough one."
167,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds really intense."
167,4,It sounds like you're finding it a bit challenging to articulate the theme.
167,5,That sounds like it's a lot to unpack.
167,6,"I'm intrigued, keep going!"
167,7,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
167,8,I just feel so deflated now.
167,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
167,10,I'm just feeling really frustrated right now.
167,11,I can see why you're frustrated.
167,12,I'm just feeling really put on the spot right now.
167,13,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was important to you."
167,14,I'm just really frustrated right now.
167,15,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
167,16,"I'm feeling a bit lost now, too."
168,0,"Okay, I'm ready."
168,1,"I know, it's a little nerve-wracking, isn't it?"
168,2,"Right, you're feeling a bit nervous about this whole thing, aren't you?"
168,3,You seem a little nervous about this.
168,4,"I know, it's a bit much, isn't it?"
168,5,"Oh, honey, you're feeling a little on edge, aren't you?"
168,6,I'm really nervous about this.
168,7,"Hey, I'm the one with the name tag."
168,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
168,9,I am freaking out right now!
168,10,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly upsetting."
168,11,"Oh, man, that's awful, I'm so sorry."
168,12,I can see why you'd be upset.
168,13,I can't believe you'd accuse me of something like that.
168,14,This is a lot to take in right now.
168,15,I'm just trying to figure out what's happening.
168,16,"This is not a good look, man."
168,17,"Hey, no need to get hostile, man."
168,18,"I'm sorry, man."
169,0,What happened?
169,1,I'm so happy!
169,2,What do you mean?
169,3,I’m so sorry you feel that way.
169,4,"I know, it’s a lot to take in."
169,5,"I know, it’s just… a lot."
169,6,I understand how much this means to you.
169,7,"Oh, honey, that must be such a shock."
169,8,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
169,9,"I know, I know."
169,10,"I know, right?"
169,11,"I know, right?"
169,12,I can't believe this is happening!
169,13,I can't believe this is happening.
169,14,"This is a lot to take in, isn't it?"
169,15,"I know, right?"
169,16,This is so confusing!
169,17,"I'm so sorry, I don't know."
169,18,This is a lot to take in.
169,19,"I’m so sorry, I feel terrible."
169,20,What is that?
169,21,What?
169,22,What?!
170,0,I missed you so much.
170,1,"It hurts, doesn’t it?"
170,2,Because I was so worried something bad happened.
170,3,I don't have any trash!
170,4,"I know, it's gross, isn't it?"
171,0,I understand.
171,1,I understand.
171,2,That sounds a little scary.
171,3,"I understand, it's hard to feel like you're taking a risk."
171,4,I'm right here with you.
171,5,"Oh wow, that's it?"
171,6,"Phew, that was close!"
171,7,"Oh, wow, that must feel really disappointing."
171,8,"Oh, wow, I can feel how disappointed you are."
172,0,"I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead."
172,1,"Oh, I can hear the urgency in your voice."
172,2,It's a relief to know I can go soon.
173,0,That sounds really sweet.
173,1,"Oh, wow, that seems like a strong reaction."
173,2,"Oh, I see, it's a bit disappointing."
173,3,"Oh, right, sock rabbits."
173,4,"Oh, you're really passionate about this."
173,5,Okay.
173,6,Okay.
173,7,"It's alright, I understand."
173,8,"It's alright, I understand."
173,9,I understand; it's okay.
173,10,"It's alright, we can figure something out."
173,11,"I understand, it's frustrating when things slip your mind."
173,12,"I know, it’s frustrating when things get mixed up."
173,13,"Oh, I appreciate that."
173,14,"I did, and I feel terrible that I forgot."
173,15,I appreciate that.
173,16,I feel terrible.
173,17,I know you will.
173,18,I can tell.
174,0,That must have been so frustrating.
174,1,I just don't know what to think.
174,2,I can see why you're frustrated.
174,3,"I'm sorry, I'm just feeling really lost right now."
174,4,"Oh, hey, what's going on?"
174,5,I'm really glad you're here too.
174,6,I understand why you'd feel that way.
174,7,I just don’t know what to do.
174,8,"I'm so sorry, that must feel awful."
174,9,"I'm so sorry, that must be confusing."
174,10,I guess not.
174,11,I don't know what's going on.
174,12,"Oh, wow, that must be tough."
174,13,"Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry."
174,14,"Oh, honey, I’m so sorry."
174,15,"I know, it’s hard when you’re feeling down."
174,16,I understand it's hard to feel like dancing right now.
174,17,"I can get you a drink, sure."
174,18,I understand.
175,0,I'd like that.
175,1,Okay.
175,2,"No, I haven't yet."
175,3,"I'm sorry, I'm ruining the mood."
175,4,"That sounds really stressful, I'm sorry."
175,5,"Oh come on, don't do this to me."
175,6,"I know, I'm sorry, I'm really trying."
175,7,"This is a lot, isn’t it?"
175,8,"Oh, I see."
175,9,"I’m sorry, I just… I really need those contracts."
175,10,I can see that you’re frustrated.
175,11,I understand this is frustrating.
175,12,I understand why you're upset.
175,13,I'm so stressed right now.
175,14,I understand you're really stressed about this.
175,15,I just... I don't know what to do.
175,16,"I know you're upset, but I really don't have them."
175,17,I can't believe this is happening.
175,18,I can see how this is frustrating.
175,19,I just… I don’t know why you’re doing this.
175,20,I just don’t understand why you’re doing this.
175,21,"I'm just really stressed, that's all."
175,22,"I’m so sorry, Rach, I didn’t mean to upset you."
176,0,"It's nice to meet you, Dirk."
176,1,"It's nice to meet you too, Dirk."
177,0,"Okay, I'm here to listen."
177,1,I just...I feel so overwhelmed right now.
177,2,"Okay, I'm listening."
178,0,"Honestly, not great, I'm really struggling."
178,1,"I'm sure they're having a great time, and you're doing just fine."
178,2,"Oh, that's so sweet."
178,3,"I'm glad you're enjoying it, Pheebs."
178,4,"Oh, that's right."
178,5,What is it?
178,6,"Oh no, what's going on?"
178,7,"I know, it's a lot to handle all at once."
178,8,"I hear you, it's tough when you feel like you're doing all the work."
178,9,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed with the situation.
179,0,"I'm so sorry, I know I haven't been there for you."
179,1,I just... I don't understand.
179,2,"I know, I'm sorry, I just...needed some space."
179,3,"It's okay, I know you're feeling confused."
180,0,It sounds like you're trying to be strong.
180,1,Okay.
180,2,Alright.
180,3,Bye.
180,4,Sounds like you're feeling good!
180,5,I'm glad to hear that!
180,6,That's fantastic!
180,7,"Oh, you don't sound so sure."
180,8,That must feel like a lot to process.
180,9,It sounds like you're feeling a bit conflicted about it.
181,0,"Oh, that sounds like such a sweet memory."
181,1,That sounds like such a sweet memory.
181,2,Hi!
181,3,"Hi, yourself."
181,4,"Oh no, that sounds really unsettling."
181,5,I can only imagine how unsettling that must have been.
182,0,"Happy Holidays to you, too."
182,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds really frustrating."
182,2,I can see why you're upset.
182,3,"Oh no, that's awful!"
182,4,"Oh no, are you okay?"
182,5,"Oh no, what do we do?"
182,6,I'm so glad I could help.
182,7,I'm so glad you're okay.
182,8,I can see why that would be alarming.
182,9,I'm so sorry.
183,0,I feel so lost right now.
183,1,I can point you in the right direction.
183,2,Oh.
183,3,I understand your frustration; that's disappointing.
183,4,I understand your frustration.
183,5,That sounds frustrating.
183,6,That sounds like a really important goal for you.
183,7,"Oh, so you're saying there's still a chance?"
183,8,I wish I had that kind of power.
184,0,I can only imagine how confusing and frightening that must have been.
184,1,I can see how that would be really frightening and confusing.
184,2,I can't believe you're saying that.
184,3,I can't believe you'd say that.
184,4,I'm just… I'm really scared.
184,5,"Oh, wow, that must have been really jarring."
184,6,I can see why you'd feel that way.
184,7,"I know it feels that way right now, but try not to worry."
184,8,It sounds like you're really worried about how this has affected your work.
184,9,"Yes, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel that way."
184,10,I can't believe this is happening.
184,11,I am.
184,12,Okay.
184,13,I understand it's a little awkward right now.
184,14,I felt so ashamed of myself.
185,0,"Graag gedaan, vriend."
185,1,It was good to see you.
185,2,I hear your frustration.
185,3,That sounds like a fun distraction.
185,4,I can tell you're excited!
185,5,That's so awesome!
185,6,I know how much you love the Knicks.
185,7,"Okay, I'm on my way!"
186,0,I can understand how you feel.
186,1,"Oh, wow, that must sting."
186,2,"Oh, I can see how that would feel disappointing."
186,3,I'm just really bummed.
187,0,"I'm feeling a bit torn, to be honest."
187,1,"It's okay, Rachel, I understand."
187,2,It's okay to have a strong preference.
187,3,I can see you're both feeling a little bit relieved.
187,4,I'm glad you think so.
187,5,"I hear you, sometimes you just need a break."
187,6,That sounds like a great idea.
187,7,"I do, yeah."
187,8,"Wow, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
188,0,"I know, it's hard to hear."
188,1,"Oh, that's disappointing."
188,2,I'm feeling really lost right now.
188,3,"Oh, Bunny, it's okay, take your time."
188,4,I know.
188,5,"Oh, Bunny."
188,6,I know.
188,7,It sounds like that was really difficult.
188,8,"It's okay, you don't have to be okay."
189,0,That sounds exciting!
189,1,That's a great choice!
189,2,It truly is a magnificent place.
189,3,"Hey, what's wrong?"
189,4,What's up?
189,5,"It really made an impression on you, huh?"
189,6,"Oh, really?"
189,7,"I don't know, I just heard they were thinking about it."
189,8,"Oh, wow, that must have felt frustrating."
189,9,That must be frustrating.
190,0,That's so exciting!
190,1,"I know, it's such a weird feeling, isn't it?"
190,2,"Oh, honey, that's so disappointing."
190,3,I appreciate you saying that.
190,4,Who?
191,0,It's okay to feel unsure.
191,1,I just feel so lost right now.
191,2,That sounds like it's bothering you.
191,3,I understand your worry.
191,4,"Oh, honey."
191,5,I remember how nervous you were.
191,6,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
191,7,"Oh, wow, that’s gotta sting a little."
191,8,That sounds frustrating.
191,9,"I'm really sorry to hear that, Rachel."
192,0,"Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry, I know how much you were looking forward to that."
192,1,"I know, I'm just feeling a little disappointed."
192,2,"Oh, so it's not the baby that's the problem then."
192,3,"I'm sorry, I must have misremembered."
192,4,"I don't know, I guess I just thought that's what you meant."
192,5,"I don't know, I just don't like the little girl."
192,6,"I understand, it must be frustrating to feel like you're not being heard."
192,7,I'm just trying to understand what's happening here.
192,8,I'm glad you think so.
192,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
192,10,"Oh, honey."
192,11,I can't believe you think that.
193,0,That's wonderful to hear!
193,1,That's wonderful news!
193,2,Sounds good!
193,3,"Oh, dear."
193,4,"Oh no, it sounds like you're struggling."
194,0,"Okay, I will."
194,1,"I know, it's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
194,2,"Oh my gosh, that's so messed up."
194,3,"I know, it's hard to believe."
194,4,"Oh, I am so sorry you had to experience that."
195,0,"I'm not mad, I just... I don't know what to do."
195,1,"Oh, honey, I'm not mad, I promise."
195,2,"Oh, honey, it's okay, I can see you feel terrible."
195,3,"No, I'm not afraid of you."
195,4,"No, I don't want that at all."
195,5,I just...I don't want to mess things up.
195,6,"I know you mean it, and I do appreciate the apology."
195,7,"Oh, honey, it sounds like you were really trying to do something nice."
195,8,Really.
195,9,I just...I really don't want to mess things up.
195,10,I'm really glad to hear you say that.
195,11,"No, no, Ross didn't sit."
196,0,"I understand, it's a lot to handle."
196,1,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating when you feel stuck like this."
196,2,I understand your frustration; it's a lot to handle.
196,3,I understand how frustrating this is.
196,4,That sounds like an incredibly painful and impossible choice.
196,5,"This is truly a nightmare scenario, I can see why you're so distraught."
196,6,I can hear the panic in your voice.
196,7,This is truly a terrible situation.
196,8,It sounds like you're truly at your wit's end.
196,9,I can't believe this is happening.
196,10,"This is really hard, isn't it?"
196,11,That's probably not what you wanted to hear.
196,12,This is truly a terrible situation to be in.
196,13,"This is impossible, isn't it?"
196,14,I understand how frustrating that must be.
196,15,"I know, it's unbelievably frustrating."
196,16,I can see how incredibly frustrating that must be.
196,17,"You're really at the end of your rope, aren't you?"
197,0,Yes?
197,1,I'm just feeling really overwhelmed right now.
197,2,"Yes, I am."
197,3,I'm a big fan.
197,4,"Oh wow, that's so sweet!"
198,0,That must be such a relief.
198,1,"Yeah, I can see how that might feel a bit awkward."
198,2,I can only imagine how frustrating that must feel.
198,3,"Yeah, but you could still feel the sting, right?"
198,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit awkward about the situation.
198,5,"Yeah, I can see how that might feel a little awkward."
198,6,I can see why you're feeling so conflicted.
198,7,"Wow, that's a lot of pressure, isn't it?"
198,8,It sounds like you're feeling a bit conflicted right now.
198,9,It must feel a little strange to be in this position.
198,10,It must feel awful to see her like that.
198,11,I can go over there now.
198,12,I'm really feeling for her right now.
199,0,"Oh no, how did it go?"
199,1,He sounded really upset.
199,2,It sounds like you're really struggling right now.
199,3,He said he needs some space.
199,4,"Oh, that must have felt awful."
199,5,I really hope you're right.
199,6,"It’s okay to feel like you don’t care, sweetie."
199,7,What are you sad about then?
199,8,It's okay to not be okay.
199,9,It's okay to feel that way; it's a lot to process.
199,10,It's okay to feel confused right now.
199,11,"No, not really."
199,12,"Oh, honey, yes."
199,13,"Oh, honey, that must be a really tough realization."
199,14,That must be hard.
199,15,You sound really hurt.
200,0,It's frustrating when things don't make sense.
200,1,I understand your frustration.
200,2,"I know, it's so frustrating when something goes missing and you don't know why."
200,3,"I know, it's so frustrating when things go missing and no one knows where they went."
200,4,"I know, this is so frustrating."
201,0,"Wow, that sounds intense."
201,1,"I know, it sounds a bit...much."
201,2,That's... a lot to take in.
201,3,That sounds like a tight squeeze!
201,4,That sounds incredibly frightening.
201,5,That sounds incredibly frightening.
201,6,That sounds absolutely terrifying.
201,7,"It was a long time ago, I was a lot smaller."
201,8,"Wow, that sounds like a really awful experience."
201,9,"I'm not going in there, no way."
201,10,You must have been terrified in there.
201,11,"Wow, that must have been terrifying."
202,0,"Not much, just feeling a bit down today."
202,1,Is everything okay?
202,2,"Oh, are you feeling a bit ignored?"
202,3,Hey! Hey-hey-hey!
202,4,Hey! I am!
202,5,That sounds really lovely.
202,6,That sounds really nice.
202,7,Anytime!
203,0,"Oh, I bet that's frustrating."
203,1,...miss the simplicity of it all.
203,2,"Yeah, I just miss having that easy breezy feeling sometimes."
203,3,I'm so sorry.
203,4,It sounds like that's a pretty tempting thought.
203,5,"Yeah, it can be such a hassle!"
203,6,"Wow, that's a big decision!"
203,7,"It's a big decision, isn't it?"
203,8,It sounds like you're feeling a real sense of liberation.
203,9,"It's a big decision, but it sounds like it would feel good."
203,10,You're very welcome.
203,11,"I know, I'm the best."
203,12,You seem pretty excited about the idea.
204,0,I know it's hard to let go.
204,1,I can see how that would feel incredibly frustrating.
204,2,I just feel so… violated.
204,3,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
204,4,That sounds incredibly frustrating and painful.
204,5,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
204,6,It sounds incredibly frustrating to see someone else seemingly effortlessly living the life you desire.
204,7,It sounds incredibly frustrating to see someone else seemingly excel at things you desire.
204,8,It stings to see someone else living out your dreams.
204,9,It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated with yourself right now.
205,0,"Oh, that must have really stung to hear."
205,1,It sounds like you really admire Mr. Salty's resilience.
205,2,It sounds like you're really passionate about your snacks!
205,3,That sounds really unsettling; I would be freaked out too.
205,4,That sounds really unsettling.
205,5,"I know, it's really unsettling."
205,6,I completely understand; that's a really unsettling feeling.
205,7,That's just... wrong.
206,0,"Yeah, it felt really good, didn't it?"
206,1,I'm glad you enjoyed it too.
206,2,"Oh no, that sounds really uncomfortable."
206,3,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
206,4,"I'm sorry, it sounds like you're really frustrated."
207,0,"It's alright, let it out."
207,1,"Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry."
208,0,Hey.
208,1,That must have been uncomfortable for you.
208,2,I feel so uncomfortable and embarrassed.
208,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncomfortable.
208,4,I guess I'm just feeling a little uncomfortable right now.
208,5,You seem really upset.
208,6,I'm feeling a little embarrassed.
208,7,"Oh, honey, that sounds really scary."
208,8,I don't want to talk about it.
208,9,"Oh, Rach, that sounds really painful."
208,10,"I'm so sorry, it must feel like you're going through this all by yourself."
208,11,I know it's hard to imagine things changing.
208,12,"It's hard to imagine that changing, isn't it?"
208,13,"It's not dumb, it's just a lot to think about."
209,0,"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize I was causing trouble."
209,1,"Whoa, easy there, buddy, what's going on?"
210,0,"I know, and I'm so sorry I'm late."
210,1,"Oh, right, I'm so sorry, I messed up the time, didn't I?"
210,2,"I'm really sorry, I'm running late."
210,3,I understand that you're frustrated with this.
210,4,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was making you feel that way."
210,5,Hi.
210,6,"Hey, it's alright."
210,7,You sound really frustrated.
210,8,"I'm sorry, I'm late."
210,9,"Oh, I get it, you're feeling a little frustrated right now."
211,0,I understand you're upset.
211,1,"He stole from me, and now I want him gone!"
211,2,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that."
211,3,I'm so sorry.
211,4,"Oh, man, that must feel like a real betrayal."
211,5,I understand this must be incredibly painful.
211,6,I can only imagine how painful this must be.
211,7,I can only imagine how betrayed you must feel right now.
212,0,"Of course, I wanted to."
212,1,"It was a really nice gesture, though."
212,2,"I know, and I'm glad I could be here."
212,3,I just feel like I'm wasting your time.
212,4,I can only imagine how that must feel.
212,5,"It’s hard, isn’t it?"
212,6,"It's just... a lot to take in, isn't it?"
213,0,It's understandable to feel that way.
213,1,"I understand, it's hard to feel inadequate."
213,2,I understand how that might feel.
213,3,It sounds like you're feeling insecure about this.
213,4,That must be so frustrating to hear all the time.
213,5,I just feel so inadequate.
213,6,Yeah.
213,7,I hope so.
213,8,"Okay, here goes nothing."
213,9,I'm here for you if you need anything.
213,10,"You're feeling a little unsure, huh?"
213,11,"You're a good friend, Chandler."
214,0,It sounds like you're feeling really discouraged right now.
214,1,I know how disappointing that can be.
214,2,I know how frustrating that must be.
214,3,"I don't know if I can, I'm just not good enough."
214,4,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up about it.
214,5,"It’s okay, you’re not alone in feeling that way."
214,6,"It sounds like you're feeling a little down on yourself, Treeger."
214,7,"It's just… frustrating, right?"
215,0,I'm so sorry; that sounds incredibly frustrating.
215,1,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really frustrating."
215,2,I feel so lost.
215,3,I understand; being cooped up can be tough.
215,4,I understand how that might feel.
215,5,It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about leaving.
215,6,It sounds like you’re trying to hold back something important.
215,7,It's okay to feel that way.
215,8,"It's hard, isn't it?"
215,9,Bye.
215,10,I understand.
216,0,"Thank you, I appreciate that so much."
216,1,Thank you!
216,2,I'm so excited for you.
216,3,"Oh, wow..."
217,0,"Oh, are you okay?"
217,1,I'm scared.
217,2,"No, I don't."
217,3,Okay.
217,4,I'm so confused right now.
217,5,"Oh, wow."
217,6,I don't think so.
217,7,That sounds really scary.
217,8,It sounds like you had a really fun night!
217,9,That's a huge relief.
217,10,I'm relieved too.
217,11,"I'm feeling so relieved, too."
218,0,"I don't know, but it feels overwhelming, doesn't it?"
218,1,I'm so scared right now.
218,2,I'm so glad you're asking for my input.
219,0,"I understand your worry, it's nerve-wracking."
219,1,"I don't know, I just... I don't know."
220,0,It smells like something's burning.
220,1,"It's awful, isn't it?"
221,0,"Yes, I do."
221,1,"Oh no, that's so frustrating."
221,2,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
221,3,"I understand, it can be stressful when things don't go smoothly."
221,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit down on yourself.
222,0,"Oh, wow, that's a lot of pressure!"
222,1,That's a tough spot to be in.
222,2,"It's okay, I understand."
222,3,That's fantastic!
222,4,Me too!
222,5,That sounds like a lot of fun!
222,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot of preparation!"
222,7,I'm so happy for you!
222,8,"A grilled cheese, but fancy!"
222,9,That sounds absolutely delicious and so thoughtful.
222,10,"Oh no, that must be so disappointing!"
222,11,"Oh, wow, that must have been disappointing."
222,12,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did that."
222,13,It sounds like you're feeling a little stressed about the cooking!
223,0,"Oh, honey, I know that doesn't make it feel any better right now."
223,1,"Oh, honey, I understand."
223,2,"It's just, I didn't think I *couldn't*."
223,3,"Oh, Chandler, I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
223,4,"Oh, Chandler, I get why you're feeling this way."
223,5,"Oh, honey."
223,6,You seem really down about this.
224,0,"It feels so good to relax, doesn't it?"
224,1,And now you are drifting.
224,2,I feel so relaxed.
224,3,Rest.
224,4,I feel so peaceful.
224,5,I understand.
224,6,I know you can quit.
224,7,That's right.
224,8,I can feel it.
225,0,I'm ready when you are.
225,1,I can hear the relief in your voice.
225,2,"Oh, no, I don't think so."
225,3,"I'm sorry, I don't get it."
225,4,I'm so relieved to finally get through.
225,5,I understand.
226,0,"Honestly, I'm really struggling."
226,1,That's great to hear.
226,2,It must be hard to get to know him.
226,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated.
226,4,It's frustrating when someone you care about keeps their feelings bottled up.
226,5,I can see why you're frustrated.
226,6,That sounds really frustrating.
226,7,Hey.
226,8,I can tell you're feeling a little frustrated.
227,0,"Oh, you're feeling a bit mischievous, aren't you?"
227,1,"Oh, honey, I can see you're completely thrown."
227,2,"I am so sorry, I didn't mean to blurt that out."
227,3,"Oh, Ben, I see you're flustered."
228,0,"Oh, that sounds like something that could easily be mixed up."
228,1,"I know it's not always that simple, is it?"
228,2,"Oh, that’s frustrating."
228,3,It's frustrating when things aren't as straightforward as they seem.
228,4,"I'm sorry, you feel that way."
228,5,I'm sorry you feel that way.
228,6,It sounds like you're feeling pretty down on yourself.
228,7,It sounds like you're really feeling burnt out right now.
228,8,It sounds like you're really feeling burnt out.
228,9,"I understand, it's a tough decision."
228,10,I hear how frustrated you are.
228,11,"Oh, wow."
228,12,"I'm so sorry, that's awful."
229,0,I can understand why that would be so captivating.
229,1,"It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
229,2,I can see how that would be really funny.
229,3,"Oh, yes, please!"
229,4,That sounds like a blast!
229,5,"Yeah, it really is."
229,6,That would be terrible.
229,7,"Sure, go right ahead."
229,8,Thanks.
229,9,That would be pretty wild.
229,10,"I know, right?"
230,0,That must have been a difficult time.
230,1,I understand; it's hard to let go.
230,2,I understand; it's hard to change your mind.
230,3,"I understand, it's hard to feel comfortable right now."
230,4,I understand your hesitation.
230,5,I'm just so tired of this.
230,6,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
230,7,I really don't want to talk about it.
230,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
231,0,"It's hard, isn't it?"
231,1,"It's tough, isn't it?"
231,2,It sounds like you're really into this Yasmine Bleeth.
231,3,I love you too.
231,4,I understand.
231,5,"I know, I know."
231,6,I'm glad you're here.
231,7,"Oh, honey, that must have been so hard."
231,8,"Oh, honey."
231,9,"Oh, honey."
231,10,That's so rough.
231,11,It's just awful to think about.
231,12,"Of course, I do."
231,13,"Oh boy, here we go."
232,0,"Oh, wow, that must be a shock."
232,1,"Oh, wow, that must be tough."
232,2,I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know yet.
232,3,"Oh, I understand, it must be hard for him."
232,4,"It's okay, it's understandable if he's not ready."
232,5,"Whoa, okay, sounds like you're really excited."
232,6,"I just want her to be happy, you know?"
232,7,I just can't believe you said that!
232,8,"And... I'm happy for you too, Mon."
232,9,"Oh, hey!"
233,0,I can only imagine how upsetting that must be.
233,1,"Oh, so this is really upsetting to you."
233,2,"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
233,3,"Oh, sweetie, I know how important this is to you."
233,4,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry if I've made you feel that way."
233,5,I just want you to be happy.
233,6,"Yeah, we did, and it's going to be that way again."
233,7,I'm so glad we did.
233,8,"That sounds great, but are you sure you're feeling up to it?"
233,9,I'm so happy to hear that!
233,10,I'm so excited!
233,11,I'm so glad!
233,12,"Oh, honey, that must have been frustrating."
233,13,I'll stop.
234,0,I'm glad.
234,1,"I'm so sorry, it isn't."
234,2,"Oh, honey, no."
234,3,I'm so sorry.
234,4,I am so disappointed right now.
234,5,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
234,6,"I am so, so angry right now."
234,7,I didn't mean it like that.
234,8,"I don't know, what's yours?"
234,9,That sounds really nice.
234,10,"It's the best, isn't it?"
234,11,I love the beach too.
234,12,I like the beach too.
234,13,That's a good one.
234,14,You think so?
235,0,"Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure I can."
236,0,I'm glad you think so.
237,0,I'm really not sure.
237,1,"Oh, good!"
237,2,I understand that's important.
237,3,"I hear you, it's tough to be dealing with this."
237,4,I really don't want to talk about it.
237,5,That sounds incredibly draining.
237,6,That sounds incredibly disheartening.
237,7,"Oh, honey, that sounds utterly deflating."
237,8,That's got to be a crushing disappointment.
237,9,I feel like I'm wearing a bra!
237,10,"Thanks, I could really use that right now."
237,11,"Oh, come on, are you sure?"
238,0,That must have been a difficult thing to process.
238,1,"I'm sure it's still hard to see her, no matter what."
238,2,"Oh, honey, I can't imagine how difficult this must be."
238,3,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
238,4,"Oh, honey, I am so sorry."
239,0,"Yes, I'm here."
239,1,"Oh, that sounds incredibly stressful."
239,2,"I don't know, I'm not sure I can remember anymore."
239,3,"Oh, wow, that must have been incredibly stressful."
239,4,"I’m having a hard time, okay?"
239,5,"It's nice to meet you, Ginger."
239,6,I'm sorry you're feeling so stressed right now.
239,7,"I really do, but I can wait."
239,8,"That's… surprisingly nice, actually."
239,9,I understand.
239,10,You sound like you're really holding on.
239,11,"Oh no, what happened?"
240,0,"Oh, honey, I can see how much this means to you."
240,1,You can't control me!
240,2,"I just want you to be safe, darling."
240,3,You really think I'd be better off without him?
240,4,"It's just a bit of acting, darling."
240,5,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
240,6,"Of course, darling."
240,7,"I appreciate that, Mother."
240,8,"No, darling, I am not."
240,9,"Oh, you poor thing."
240,10,"I know it’s confusing, honey."
240,11,"Oh, honey, that must be so overwhelming."
240,12,"I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you."
240,13,I think I'm going to be sick.
240,14,No one told me anything.
240,15,I…I think I need a drink.
240,16,"I don’t know, I didn’t really pay attention."
241,0,"No, I don't."
241,1,Good.
241,2,Good.
241,3,That sounds like a pretty strong urge.
241,4,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure.
241,5,"Hey, sounds like you're feeling pretty amped up."
241,6,You sound excited!
241,7,Maybe.
241,8,"Well, it's a small world, isn't it?"
241,9,"Oh wow, that must be exciting!"
241,10,That's so cool!
241,11,That's amazing!
241,12,Yeah!
241,13,That's quite a career shift!
241,14,You are very kind.
242,0,What's on your mind?
242,1,"I'm sorry, I know this is frustrating."
242,2,"I understand, it's incredibly frustrating."
242,3,"I know it's hard, but you can do this."
242,4,I can see that's really hard for you.
242,5,"I'm so sorry, it's hard."
242,6,It sounds like you could really use some help.
242,7,That sounds incredibly overwhelming.
243,0,I understand it can be frustrating when things aren't where they should be.
243,1,I understand that can be frustrating.
243,2,"Oh, I see."
243,3,She's lucky to have you.
243,4,That's a really frustrating situation.
243,5,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
244,0,I can see how stressful it must be to keep all of that a secret.
244,1,It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now.
244,2,I understand this is difficult.
244,3,What's going on?
244,4,I can only imagine how frustrating that must feel.
244,5,I just feel so alone in this whole process.
244,6,"Oh no, that sounds awful."
244,7,"Ugh, I can’t believe that guy."
244,8,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
244,9,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
244,10,I’m guessing you’re just about done with dating.
244,11,"Oh, wow."
244,12,"Oh, I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
244,13,That sounds like a bad omen.
244,14,It sounds like you're really frustrated.
244,15,"I get that, it can be frustrating."
244,16,You seem really down about it.
244,17,"Okay, that makes sense."
244,18,"It’s been a rough one, huh?"
244,19,Oh yeah?
244,20,"Yeah, it's such a relief when things start to make sense."
244,21,"That’s... really great, Chandler."
245,0,Hey there.
245,1,How are you doing today?
245,2,They're just some things I've been working on.
245,3,They're...a lot.
245,4,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
246,0,I can see this is really hard for you.
246,1,That's a hard thing to accept.
246,2,I know it's hard to accept.
246,3,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and frustrated.
246,4,It must be hard to see someone you knew so well and feel so distant.
246,5,It must be difficult to see someone you knew change like that.
246,6,"Oh, Rhonda, that must be so hard."
246,7,"Oh, wow, that must feel strange."
246,8,"Oh, wow, that must feel strange."
246,9,I remember the time we went to the zoo.
246,10,"Oh, honey, that must feel awful."
246,11,It must feel awful to be ignored.
246,12,It must be frustrating to feel like you're being shut out.
246,13,It’s hard when things change like that.
247,0,"It's brewing, but I'm feeling a bit sluggish this morning."
247,1,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
247,2,"Oh, that sounds uncomfortable."
247,3,I just can't help myself sometimes.
247,4,It must be frustrating to feel stuck sometimes.
248,0,I understand; it sounds like you're going through a lot right now.
249,0,I understand.
249,1,I'm sorry.
249,2,I appreciate that.
249,3,"Oh, really?"
249,4,I'm excited to hear about it!
249,5,I'm so glad.
249,6,I'm on my way.
249,7,"You're very welcome, dear."
250,0,"Oh, wow."
250,1,Oh.
250,2,"I know this is hard, but I'm sure you'll be okay."
250,3,I understand this is hard to hear.
250,4,"Okay, bye."
250,5,"I'm sorry, that must have stung."
250,6,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really tough."
250,7,"I'm so sorry, that sounds really painful."
250,8,I understand.
251,0,"Wow, that must have been a lot to take in."
251,1,"It's okay, sometimes things just feel overwhelming."
251,2,I understand.
251,3,"Yeah, I guess I am."
251,4,"Oh, wow, that's gotta sting a bit."
252,0,I understand your frustration.
252,1,I'm really frustrated right now.
252,2,I'm sorry you're feeling so frustrated.
252,3,It sounds like you're really frustrated and hurt right now.
252,4,That must feel incredibly unfair.
252,5,That sounds incredibly difficult.
252,6,It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated right now.
252,7,It's okay to feel overwhelmed by that request.
252,8,It must feel like you're being blamed for everything.
252,9,"You're really hurting, aren't you?"
252,10,It sounds like you're really hurting right now.
252,11,"It just sucks, doesn't it?"
252,12,"It's so hard to just let it go, isn't it?"
252,13,It's so tough to let go of something that stings.
252,14,I can imagine.
252,15,I know you're hurting.
252,16,It sounds like you're really struggling with keeping those memories buried.
252,17,I can only imagine how frustrating that must be.
252,18,I can see how much you’re still hurting.
253,0,It must be a lot to process.
253,1,That sounds like a really difficult situation.
253,2,"That makes sense, it's hard to jump into something new right away."
253,3,"That sounds like it could be a fun, low-pressure situation for you."
253,4,"She is, and she's really hoping to find someone."
253,5,"Oh wow, you seem pretty excited."
253,6,"That's great to hear, I'm so happy for you both!"
253,7,"Well, this is exciting!"
253,8,"That sounds like a plan, buddy."
253,9,"I know, I know, I’m being a little pushy."
253,10,I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now.
253,11,That sounds like a great idea.
253,12,"I can tell you aren't sure, and that's okay."
254,0,"I'm coming, I'm coming, just give me a second."
254,1,"Easy, buddy, let's focus on getting her to the hospital."
254,2,"Okay, okay, I'm coming."
254,3,"I know, I know, it's just... this is a lot."
254,4,"It's okay, you'll still look beautiful."
254,5,I can't believe you're in the fridge right now.
254,6,"I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do that right now."
254,7,"I'm sorry, I just wanted to make a good impression."
254,8,"Oh, honey, you must be so nervous."
254,9,What? You don't think I'm ready?
254,10,You must be really nervous right now.
254,11,I'm sorry you're feeling that way.
254,12,"I know, it's a lot to take in right now."
254,13,"I know, it's amazing, isn't it?"
254,14,"I'm so excited for you, I can't believe it's actually happening!"
254,15,"I'm so excited for you, too!"
254,16,I'm so excited!
254,17,"I know, it's all a bit much right now."
255,0,I'm here.
255,1,I... I don't understand.
255,2,It's... it's just hard to explain.
255,3,I'm glad I could be clear.
255,4,"Oh, wow, that's so exciting!"
255,5,"I know, right?"
255,6,"Wow, that's a big leap."
255,7,That's amazing!
255,8,"Oh no, is everything okay?"
256,0,I just felt really lost and needed someone.
256,1,"Oh, wow, that must be really difficult."
257,0,That sounds like a nice place to live.
257,1,"Yeah, I think so."
257,2,I'd really like that.
257,3,That sounds really nice.
257,4,Sounds like fun.
258,0,"Oh, you're really struggling with this, aren't you?"
258,1,I understand wanting something that feels widely appealing.
258,2,"Oh, that sounds like a real challenge."
258,3,It's tough when you feel like you need to change yourself.
258,4,It's frustrating when you feel like your name doesn't fit you.
258,5,It's frustrating when you feel like you're not being represented accurately.
258,6,"That's a tough one, I understand."
258,7,"It's frustrating to feel like you can't quite put your finger on it, isn't it?"
258,8,"It's frustrating when you can't quite place something, isn't it?"
258,9,You seem to like it!
258,10,"You're really trying to find the perfect fit, aren't you?"
258,11,You seem excited about the name.
258,12,"It's frustrating when something seems so close but doesn't quite fit, isn't it?"
259,0,I understand your frustration.
259,1,I just don't know what to say.
259,2,I know this is difficult.
259,3,I just don't know what to say.
259,4,I know it can be frustrating to feel misunderstood.
259,5,That must have been quite the experience.
259,6,I can see how important this is to you.
259,7,"You're really upset, aren't you?"
259,8,You sound really frustrated.
259,9,I can see you're frustrated.
259,10,I can see why you'd feel that way.
259,11,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
259,12,I hear you.
259,13,I can see why you're so upset.
259,14,I understand you're really upset right now.
259,15,I'm just trying to understand where all of this is coming from.
260,0,That's wonderful to hear!
260,1,"Good for you, Rachel!"
260,2,I know how hard it can be to keep secrets sometimes.
260,3,"Oh, no, what happened?"
260,4,I am so glad you liked it!
260,5,"Oh no, what happened?"
260,6,"I just got so excited, and then I got really disappointed."
260,7,"Oh, honey."
260,8,I think I might.
260,9,That's so exciting!
260,10,"Okay, okay, I understand."
261,0,"Of course, I would."
261,1,"Wow, that's... incredible."
261,2,Of course.
261,3,"Okay, I can do that."
261,4,Awesome!
261,5,"Okay, I'll bite."
261,6,"Good, I'm glad to hear it."
261,7,"Okay, I get it."
261,8,You okay?
262,0,Hello there!
262,1,"Hey, what's up?"
262,2,"Yeah, I'm stoked to finally have them."
262,3,"It was good, thanks for asking."
262,4,"Well, that doesn't sound good."
262,5,"I'm sorry, it wasn't a good trip."
262,6,"Oh man, that's a bit of a letdown, huh?"
262,7,I'm glad you like them!
262,8,Sure! I'd love some.
262,9,Coming right up.
262,10,"Decaf, please."
262,11,"Okay, coming right up."
262,12,Is everything alright?
262,13,"Okay, I'm listening."
262,14,I did a thing.
262,15,"Wow, that's a lot to take in!"
262,16,"Wow, that's a lot to take in."
263,0,Hi there.
263,1,What's on your mind?
263,2,I've been feeling a bit lost lately.
263,3,"Oh no, everything okay?"
263,4,"No, but she did have to get stitches."
263,5,"Oh, wow, that must be a lot to take in."
263,6,"Oh, wow."
263,7,"Oh, wow, that sounds really stressful."
263,8,I don't know.
263,9,"Oh, wow, that's got to be so difficult."
264,0,"Oh no, that's so frustrating!"
264,1,"This is so frustrating, I know."
264,2,"No, I didn't do any of this."
264,3,"Wow, you must have been really busy!"
265,0,"Oh wow, that must have been such a shock to see them again after all this time."
265,1,"Wow, that sounds like quite the reunion!"
266,0,"Yes, of course, please come in."
266,1,What's wrong?
266,2,Do you feel alright?
266,3,"I'm just feeling a bit lost, I guess."
266,4,It sounds like you're not feeling so great.
266,5,"Okay, I'm listening."
266,6,"Alright, I hear you."
266,7,"I understand, and I wouldn't want that either."
266,8,I understand.
266,9,I just want to feel something.
266,10,"Oh, Ross."
266,11,I'm not sure I understand.
266,12,I'm not.
266,13,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like this."
266,14,I'm so embarrassed.
266,15,I just thought... maybe...
266,16,I can't believe this is happening.
267,0,Hey.
267,1,"Hey, what's up?"
267,2,"Oh, man, that's rough."
267,3,"I'm so sorry, that's terrible timing."
267,4,"Oh wow, that's a lot of pressure, huh?"
267,5,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
267,6,I'm not sure I can do this.
267,7,That sounds like a lot.
267,8,"Oh, I see, you're not sure."
267,9,"Oh, come on, don't be like that."
267,10,I understand it's a lot to take in.
268,0,That sounds like a huge relief.
268,1,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly upsetting to hear."
268,2,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating and disappointing."
268,3,"Hey, it's okay."
268,4,It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost right now.
268,5,Hi.
268,6,I appreciate you being here for me.
268,7,I'm here for you.
268,8,"That's a small comfort, but I appreciate you saying it."
268,9,"That's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
268,10,"I know, it's incredibly frustrating."
268,11,That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in right now.
268,12,I know this is a lot to take in.
268,13,"It's a lot to take in, isn't it?"
269,0,It sounds like you're feeling a little unsure about it.
269,1,I'm sorry; I didn't mean to upset you.
269,2,I just feel so silly for getting so worked up.
269,3,"I understand, it's hard to feel pressured like that."
269,4,"Oh, wow, you're really excited to share!"
270,0,"She's not here right now, can I help you with something?"
270,1,"Oh, okay, I understand."
270,2,I understand; that must be a bit awkward.
270,3,"Okay, thanks."
270,4,I understand; it's important to get things where they need to be.
270,5,It's a human skull.
270,6,That must be quite a sight.
270,7,"Okay, thanks."
270,8,I can understand why you'd be surprised.
270,9,I guess I never thought about it like that.
270,10,I'm glad you appreciate it.
270,11,That's so sweet.
270,12,I can see how that might sound a little strange.
270,13,I guess I just never thought about it.
270,14,"It's a special time, isn't it?"
271,0,I understand that can be frustrating.
271,1,I understand you're frustrated.
271,2,I'm really not doing well right now.
271,3,"Oh no, that sounds terrifying!"
271,4,I'm here.
271,5,"I'm so sorry, that sounds absolutely terrifying."
272,0,"Wow, that sounds like a really overwhelming morning."
272,1,"Oh, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
272,2,"Oh, wow, that's incredibly frustrating."
272,3,That sounds incredibly stressful.
272,4,That sounds like a lot to deal with all at once.
272,5,I can hear how incredibly stressed you are right now.
273,0,I haven't seen him.
273,1,"Oh no, is everything alright?"
273,2,"I'm so sorry, are you okay?"
273,3,"I'm just worried about you, buddy."
274,0,I understand.
274,1,I'm just so stressed about this whole thing.
274,2,I can see why you might think that.
274,3,I'm not sure I should.
274,4,"Awesome, let's go!"
275,0,I'm sorry to hear that.
275,1,I understand.
275,2,Okay.
275,3,Okay.
276,0,Hey.
277,0,I just feel so lost and overwhelmed right now.
278,0,"Oh my gosh, that sounds absolutely violating and awful."
278,1,That is absolutely violating and awful.
278,2,That sounds incredibly violating.
278,3,"That sounds exciting, but I'm still reeling from what happened on the train."
278,4,"Oh honey, that's a bummer."
278,5,I know it can be hard to find a photo you both love.
278,6,That sounds frustrating.
278,7,"I am so sorry, that sounds awful."
278,8,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
278,9,"Wow, that's a bummer, I know how frustrating that can be."
278,10,I'm sorry; that must be so frustrating.
278,11,It's frustrating when you feel like you're always missing the mark.
278,12,That’s a really good idea!
278,13,That sounds like it would be fun!
278,14,"You’re really not happy with any of the pictures, are you?"
278,15,I think that’s really nice of you to include him.
278,16,"Oh honey, that's so frustrating!"
279,0,I can see you're really upset.
279,1,I understand you're upset about that.
279,2,I don't think I did.
279,3,I just want them back.
279,4,I just want you to leave me alone!
279,5,I don't want to share.
279,6,"Okay, maybe we can share."
279,7,It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and confused right now.
279,8,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.
279,9,That sounds really frustrating.
279,10,It sounds like you're feeling really self-conscious and unsure.
279,11,"That makes sense, it's probably not that big of a deal."
279,12,I understand.
279,13,I guess that makes me feel better.
279,14,I think it's worth a shot if you're feeling unsure.
279,15,"It's just that you really hate it, don't you?"
