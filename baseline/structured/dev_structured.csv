11,8,I can't believe I did this!
11,9,"This is not good, is it?"
11,10,"I know, I know, it's a disaster."
11,11,Because she's Monica!
11,12,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't know."

14,0,Hey! What's up?
14,1,How are you doing today?
14,2,"Sure, I understand you must be a little frustrated right now."
14,3,I just can't seem to find him.

16,3,That must be so exciting and terrifying all at once.
16,4,It must be incredibly frustrating to deal with that.

16,7,That must be frustrating.
16,8,It sounds like you're really frustrated right now.

16,12,It sounds like you're really hurting.
16,13,It sounds like you're really hurting.

18,0,Hey!
18,1,I'm just feeling so lost right now.
18,2,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
18,3,"He's late for our date, and he's never late."
18,4,"Oh, no!"
18,5,"Oh, honey, that's amazing news!"

18,7,"Oh, Monica, this is a lot to take in, isn't it?"
18,8,"Oh, honey, that sounds absolutely awful!"
18,9,I don't know!
18,10,"Oh, Monica, I'm so sorry."
18,11,"I'm so sorry, Monica."
18,12,"I'm so sorry, I really am."
18,13,"I’m so sorry, Monica."

19,13,You're right; this is a disaster.
19,14,I understand how much this hurts.
19,15,I know it doesn't feel like it right now.
19,16,"I know, right?"
19,17,I'm sorry you're feeling this way.
19,18,That sounds incredibly difficult.
19,19,"I know, it's a lot to process."
19,20,"It's a lot to process, isn't it?"
19,21,I know.
19,22,"I'm really sorry, too."

20,1,"I'm alright, just a little bored."
20,2,"Oh, thanks, Kelly!"
20,3,"Oh my gosh, I love that!"
20,4,I'm glad you like it!
20,5,"I know, it's awful."
20,6,I understand; it's upsetting when something is so repulsive.
20,7,"I know, it's so frustrating when you're left hanging like that!"
21,0,I can see why you'd say that.
21,1,"It's true, he really commits to the look."
21,2,"Oh, wow, I didn't know that."
21,3,"No, I'm just saying... he's got style."
21,4,"Oh, hi Danielle!"
21,5,"Hey, Danielle."
21,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting something."
22,0,I'm just feeling really lost right now.
22,1,"I don't know, I just feel so lost."
22,2,I'm not sure I understand.
22,3,"Yes, that's what it is."
22,4,"Oh, wow."
22,5,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly painful."
22,6,"I'm so sorry, that must be incredibly painful."
22,7,I just... I don't even know what to say.
22,8,"Oh, wow."
22,9,It was the best sex I've ever had.
22,10,It was your what?
22,11,It was perfect.
22,12,"Oh, wow."
22,13,"That's a rough realization, isn't it?"

23,3,We just can't seem to agree on anything anymore.
23,4,I am so sorry to hear that.
23,5,"I'm so incredibly sorry, that must be devastating."
23,6,It’s okay to feel that way right now.
23,7,I can only imagine how blindsided and heartbroken you must feel.
23,8,"I wouldn't know, but I'm so sorry, this must be awful."
23,9,"I'm so sorry, man, that's just awful."
23,10,"Hey, don't be sorry, you're allowed to feel this."
23,11,"I am so sorry, man."
23,12,You must be devastated.
23,13,I'm so sorry.
24,0,I understand.
24,1,I really wish you wouldn’t say that.
24,2,It sounds like you really want to believe him.
24,3,I just don’t know how to do that.
24,4,I know this is hard.
24,5,I appreciate that.
24,6,I'm glad you're feeling so sure about this.
24,7,I am so sorry.
24,8,I know you're probably feeling confused right now.

25,2,I'm sorry you feel that way.
25,3,I'm sorry you feel that way.
25,4,"I understand, it's disappointing when things don't go as planned."
25,5,I understand that you're feeling disappointed.
26,0,Yes?
26,1,I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.
26,2,I'm listening.
26,3,"Yes, I was."
26,4,"Oh, so this is about your brother?"
26,5,"Oh, wow."
26,6,I can't believe this is happening.
26,7,I feel so betrayed right now.
26,8,I know this must be incredibly painful to hear.
26,9,I just don't understand how you could.
26,10,"I know I messed up, and I feel awful."
26,11,I just feel so betrayed.
26,12,I'm so sorry you feel that way.
26,13,I just don't know what to believe anymore.
26,14,I can't believe you think that.
26,15,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
26,16,I think I need some time to process this.
27,0,That sounds exciting!
27,1,That sounds frustrating.
27,2,I just don’t feel ready.
27,3,I just feel so frustrated right now.
27,4,"Oh, that must be so frustrating."
27,5,I'm dying to know!
27,6,"I understand, it must be hard keeping it a secret."
27,7,"Wow, that must be a lot to take in."
27,8,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
27,9,I can't believe this is happening!
28,0,I understand.
28,1,"I hear you, it's tough sometimes."
28,2,That sounds disappointing.
28,3,"That's a bummer, I bet you wish you did."
28,4,"That sounds frustrating, to not have those memories."
28,5,"I understand, sometimes it's hard to revisit painful memories."
28,6,I really don't want to talk about it.
28,7,That must have been awful.
28,8,"I know, right?!"
28,9,"You're curious to know how it happened, aren't you?"
28,10,It's just awful.
29,0,I understand you're really upset right now.
29,1,"It was Wendy, and I'm really upset."

29,9,"I'm so sorry, I know you're in a tough spot."
29,10,"I'm so sorry, I really can't."
30,0,"I know, it's terrifying."
30,1,I can't leave you!
30,2,I don't want to die alone.
30,3,I can't leave you here!
30,4,I... I never thought you'd say that.
30,5,I can't lose you.
30,6,I…I think I understand.
30,7,I'm so sorry.
30,8,I... I think I understand.
30,9,"Oh, wow."
30,10,I guess we both were.
30,11,We should have gotten more takes.
30,12,"Okay, I hear you."
30,13,I'm going to miss you.
30,14,I’m sorry.
30,15,"It's like that, huh?"
30,16,I guess we'll just see about that.
30,17,"Alright then, go on!"
30,18,I can’t believe you!
31,0,"I know, it's hard to accept."
31,1,He was like a brother to me.
31,2,"It's still hard to lose someone like that, even if you weren't super close."
31,3,"It's still hard to believe he's really gone, isn't it?"
31,4,That's a beautiful image.
31,5,"Oh, honey, I know how much you must be hurting right now."
31,6,It's awful to feel like you missed an opportunity.
31,7,"It's okay, you can still feel this way."
31,8,I'm just overwhelmed right now.
31,9,I'm so glad to hear that.
31,10,I'm just so glad to hear you say that.
31,11,"I am so sorry, Kori."
31,12,"Oh, Kori, I'm so sorry you're feeling this way."
32,0,"Okay, I understand."
32,1,How are you feeling right now?
32,2,"Yeah, that must be unsettling."
32,3,I understand that must be stressful.
32,4,"Terrified, actually."
32,5,I understand.
32,6,"Oh wow, that's exciting and maybe a little overwhelming all at once."
32,7,I understand how you feel.
32,8,I am a little anxious.
32,9,I understand you want to speed things up.
32,10,"Oh, so you're eager to get things moving."
32,11,"I understand, you're eager to get this going."
32,12,I'm willing to try anything at this point.
32,13,I bet you're ready for this to be over.
33,0,I'm worried about her too.
33,1,That must have been so disappointing for her.
34,0,I'm here.
34,1,I'm here for you.
34,2,I'm right here with you.
34,3,But...?
34,4,I understand.
34,5,I'm here for you.
34,6,"It's alright, take your time."
34,7,I understand; it's a lot to take in.
34,8,I understand it feels that way.
34,9,It's alright to feel that way.
34,10,"It's alright, take your time."
35,0,"Hi Mark, what's up?"
36,0,"No, I don't want to."
36,1,I'm here for you.
36,2,"Okay, I'm going."
36,3,I know you do.
36,4,Thank you.
36,5,I wish I could.
36,6,"You're scared, aren't you?"
36,7,I'll be right there.
36,8,I'm so scared.
36,9,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
36,10,"It hurts so bad, doesn't it?"
36,11,"Oh, honey, what happened?"
37,0,It must be so tense right now.
37,1,"Oh, you're really worried about him, aren't you?"
37,2,"I know, it's hard to see."
37,3,I'm so relieved to hear that!
37,4,"Yes, he's really giving Bruiser a run for his money!"
37,5,"Oh, no..."
37,6,"Oh no, not the face!"
37,7,I can't look either.
37,8,"Oh, no..."
37,9,I can see why you'd say that.
37,10,That must be so frustrating.
38,0,"I know, it's tough when you feel like you're falling behind."
39,0,I think that's a really kind thought.
39,1,"That sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm not sure how Rachel would feel."
39,2,"Oh wow, things are getting heated!"
40,0,It sounds like you were really down on yourself.
40,1,"Oh wow, that must have stung."
40,2,I told him you were way out of his league.
40,3,Thank goodness.
40,4,I'm so sorry you had to hear that.
40,5,I can’t believe he asked you that.
40,6,"He said, ""Oh. Okay."""
40,7,"Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry."
40,8,"Okay, I can do that."
40,9,"I know, it's a lot to take in right now."
40,10,I can see how upset you are.
41,0,"Oh, that's a relief."
41,1,Are you alright?
41,2,It sounds like you’re disappointed.
42,0,"Oh no, that's frustrating!"
42,1,"I'm so sorry, that's frustrating!"
42,2,I know how frustrating that can be.
42,3,I'm so sorry; I know you're upset.
42,4,I'm so sorry.
43,0,"Okay, I will."
43,1,Be safe.
44,0,"I'm sorry, I should have."
44,1,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up."
44,2,I appreciate that.
44,3,"I'm sorry, it sounds like that was pretty rough."
44,4,I'd really like that.
44,5,Great!
44,6,I'd really like that.
44,7,That's... really great.
44,8,I'm really glad to hear that.
44,9,"Okay, bye."
44,10,Bye.
44,11,"Oh, no worries, I'll get it for you."
45,0,I'm ready.
45,1,I'm nervous too.
45,2,I'm ready.
45,3,"Oh no, are you alright?"
45,4,I don't want to.
45,5,I understand.
45,6,"Oh, honey."
45,7,It sounds like you're really not comfortable with the idea.
45,8,"Oh, honey."
45,9,"Oh, honey."
45,10,"I'm so sorry, that sounds awful!"
45,11,"Oh, that's awful!"
46,0,I believe you.
46,1,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
46,2,I understand you're looking for him.
46,3,"Oh, I understand."
46,4,"Oh, that must have been so upsetting for him."
46,5,"I don't know, I just feel so bad for him."
46,6,"Oh, honey."
46,7,I know it’s a tough situation.
46,8,I can see how difficult this is for you.
46,9,"I know it's hard, but he deserves to know."
47,0,I'm just feeling really lost right now.
47,1,"Oh, wow, that's a pretty specific thing to remember."
47,2,"Oh, wow, that must feel really strange to watch."
47,3,I don't know.
47,4,"Oh, that must be hard."
47,5,"No, it's okay, come in."
47,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot to deal with right now."
47,7,"Yeah, we eloped."
47,8,"Oh, I see."
47,9,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
47,10,I understand.
48,0,"I have no idea, but I'm invested in this now."
48,1,That sounds like fun!
48,2,I'm so glad you think so!
48,3,No!
48,4,"I know, it's so frustrating when something is so close to working."
48,5,It’s okay; we’ll figure something out.
48,6,What's wrong?
48,7,"I know, it feels really overwhelming right now."
49,0,I understand you're really upset right now.
49,1,I just can't believe you don't see it.
49,2,I understand you're upset.
49,3,I can see you're frustrated.
49,6,I can see you're really upset.
49,7,I just want this to be over.
49,8,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
49,9,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
49,10,"I'm sorry, I just... I'm frustrated too."
49,11,"I'm sorry, I know it's hard to keep it down right now."
49,12,"I know, it's just so frustrating."
49,13,"I know, it's frustrating when things escalate."
49,14,I'm sorry you're feeling like this.
50,0,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry."
50,1,"I don't know, but it looks like someone really wanted to upset you."
50,2,"I know, it's so frustrating when something like this happens."
50,3,That must be so frustrating.
51,0,That sounds like a lot to take in.
51,1,I can see why you'd say that.
51,2,"Oh no, what's wrong with Carl's acting?"
51,3,"The only problem is, Carl’s acting is... not very good."
51,4,"Oh no, I can imagine that would be incredibly frustrating."
51,5,I'm sorry to hear that things aren't going so well.
51,6,"Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
52,0,"Sure, let him in, I'm sure it will make the chef's day!"
52,1,"Go ahead, I'm happy to see the chef get some recognition!"
52,2,"Oh, that's so nice!"
53,0,"Oh, wow."
53,1,"It's confusing when the moment passes, isn't it?"
53,2,I understand.
53,3,I can wait.
53,4,I understand; it's hard to wait when you feel that way.
53,5,"I know, it’s hard."
53,6,I'm ready.
53,7,"I know, I'm just excited."
53,8,I get that.
54,0,Yes?
54,1,What's on your mind?
54,2,"Oh, wow."
54,3,"Well, I'd probably go with world peace and the bigger boobs."
54,4,"Oh, honey."
54,5,"I know, it's like, the ultimate buzzkill."
54,6,That must feel disappointing.
54,7,I'd want a sandwich.
54,8,"Oh, Joey, are you okay?"
54,9,"I'm so sorry to hear you say that, Joey."
54,10,"Oh, Joey."
54,11,"Oh, Joey..."
54,12,"Oh, Joey..."
55,0,"It's okay, I understand."
56,0,I'm so nervous.
56,1,I'll try my best.
56,2,I just don't want to be alone right now.
56,3,"I'm right here, Joey."
56,4,I understand; it's hard to leave.
56,5,"I'm so sorry, Joey."
56,6,I don't want you to go.
56,7,"Yeah, this is it."
56,8,I understand.
56,9,"I know, it's hard."
56,10,I won't forget you either.
56,11,I'll always remember you too.
56,12,I can't believe you're actually leaving.
56,13,"I know, it’s just… a lot to take in."
56,14,I'm going to miss you terribly.
56,15,"Oh, Adrienne, that's… that's a lot to process."
56,16,"Goodbye, Joey."
57,0,"""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston?"
57,1,"Oh no, that's so frustrating when you can't quite remember!"
57,2,"""Can you believe I forgot the name?"""
57,3,Hey!
57,4,Hey!
57,5,Hey!
57,6,I can only imagine how you feel.
57,7,"Oh, honey, that sounds rough."
57,8,That sounds incredibly tough.
57,9,"Oh, honey."
57,10,"Oh, honey."
57,11,"Oh, honey."
57,12,"Oh, honey, that sounds absolutely brutal."
58,0,"I'd really like to, but I'm just not feeling up to it."
58,1,"Oh, wow, that sounds really tough."
58,2,"It's okay to feel that way, truly."
58,3,"I appreciate that, man."
58,4,"I'm glad to hear it, and I understand it might be awkward."
58,5,"Yeah, that sounds awesome, thanks!"
58,6,I just wanted to do something nice for you.
58,7,I'm on my way!
58,8,I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable with me.
58,9,"You're really pulling out all the stops, aren't you?"
58,10,That sounds like a great idea.
58,11,That sounds like fun.
59,0,That sounds like a pretty tough situation.
59,1,That would be a pretty good foxhole.
59,2,"I understand, it's tough when your values clash with something like that."
59,3,That sounds like a difficult position to be in.
59,4,I appreciate that.
60,0,What's wrong?
60,1,That sounds like a real comfort food classic.
60,2,I understand this is difficult.
60,3,I can see you're really upset.
60,4,"It's been a long time since you've heard it, hasn't it?"
60,5,I remember when you made that for me.
60,6,I am so glad you think so.
61,0,Hi there.
61,1,How are you doing?
61,2,What are you up to?
61,3,I'm going to a concert!
61,4,That sounds like fun!
61,5,I know you've been wanting this for a while.
62,0,I'm so nervous just thinking about it.
62,1,"Wow, that must feel really exciting and a little nerve-wracking!"
62,2,I'm really excited about this!
62,3,"Oh wow, so you are really excited about this."
62,4,"Yeah, I can see how this could be a lot to process."
62,5,"Yeah, I'm feeling pretty worked up about it as well."
63,0,That sounds like it would have been really special.
63,1,I know you're disappointed.
63,2,I know it's disappointing when something you envision doesn't work out.
63,3,"I'm really glad you enjoyed it, too."
63,4,It sounds like you really enjoyed the experience.
63,5,"Sure, what's up?"
63,6,Are you okay?
63,7,"Yeah, what about it?"
63,8,It just felt like you weren't taking it seriously.
63,9,"No, I'm not kidding."
63,10,"It actually meant something to you, didn't it?"
63,11,I'm glad you thought so.
63,12,"No, I really did think it was wonderful."
63,13,Oh.
63,14,"Oh, Ross…"
63,15,"Oh, Ross..."
63,16,"Good night, Ross."
63,17,Goodnight.
63,18,I can see how much you loved planning this.
63,19,I'm glad you're open to considering it.
63,20,I’m glad you’re still thinking about it.
64,0,"Oh, wow, that sounds really awful."
64,1,"Oh no, that's awful!"
64,2,"Oh, wow."
64,3,"Oh, wow, that's…that's really something."
64,4,"Oh, wow, you really went above and beyond."
65,0,That's a huge weight off your shoulders.
65,1,"Oh, that's a huge relief."
65,2,I'm really glad to hear you say that.
65,3,"Oh, wow, that sounds like a lot."
65,4,"Oh, wow, that must have been a lot."
65,5,"Haha, oh my god."
65,6,I can imagine how that might have felt!
65,7,"Oh, thank goodness."
65,8,I understand that might be a little frustrating.
65,9,I understand.
65,10,It sounds like you're having a good time!
66,0,"I know, it's so hard when they go."
66,1,"Oh, honey, I hope that’s it."
66,2,That would be a lot to take in all at once.
66,3,"Oh, honey, I get it; you're really worried."
66,4,"I know, it's hard not to jump to conclusions when you care so much."
66,5,"I don't know, I feel so lost right now."
66,6,I'm so worried about you guys.
66,7,"I'm really worried about him, too."
66,8,I will.
66,11,"Okay, so you'll find him."
67,0,Hey there!
67,1,Hey!
67,2,I wish I did!
67,3,"Oh, that's exciting!"
67,4,"No problem, I understand."
67,5,That sounds like it could be a little overwhelming.
67,6,"I don't even know, and I probably should."
67,7,"Oh, that sounds like a lot of pressure."
67,8,"I'm sure he does, and it's frustrating."
67,9,"Oh, that does sound stressful, I understand."
67,10,Someone who won't make me want to run screaming from the room.
68,0,Hey there! What's up?
68,1,"Nothing much, just chilling."
68,2,That sounds like fun!
68,3,"Yeah, I thought you knew."
68,4,"I'm a little nervous about it, too."
68,5,"Oh wow, that sounds a bit nerve-wracking."
68,6,"Oh wow, that must be a lot to process."
68,7,"I understand, that must be nerve-wracking."
68,8,I can only imagine how much pressure you're feeling right now.
68,9,That's so great to hear!
68,10,I'm so glad we can be there for you.
68,11,I appreciate you guys being so supportive.
69,0,"Not great, to be honest."
69,1,That sounds really difficult.
69,2,That sounds really difficult.
69,3,"Yeah, I'm it."
69,4,"Yeah, I really need to get going."
69,5,"I'm sorry, I can see you're upset."
69,6,That sounds really stressful.
69,7,That's a long way from here.
69,8,I'm sorry you feel that way.
69,9,"I'm really sorry, I know that must be difficult to bring up."
69,10,I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.
69,11,I can imagine that's been weighing on you.
69,12,It sounds like you're really regretting it.
69,13,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
69,14,It sounds like you really want things to go back to normal.
69,15,I understand.
69,16,I can see why you'd think that.
69,17,"I'm sorry, that must have felt really dismissive."
69,18,Yeah.
69,19,I could never do that.
70,0,"Whoa, easy there, you seem really worked up."
70,1,"Yeah, I can see how that would be satisfying."
70,2,You seem really invested in this game.
70,3,I can't believe we pulled it off!
70,4,I can see how much you're enjoying this!
70,5,"That's right, we're famous!"
71,0,"That's awesome, I can feel your excitement!"
71,1,It's great we both got what we wanted!
71,2,That's awesome!
71,3,"I know, right? It's awesome!"
71,4,That sounds amazing!
71,5,That's amazing!
72,0,I feel so incredibly unprepared right now.
72,1,Then why can't you answer any of the questions?
72,2,"I'm trying, but it's just not coming to me right now."
72,3,"Oh, Joseph."
72,4,"I know this is hard, but you've got this."
72,5,I understand this is frustrating.
72,6,I'm just really stressed right now.
72,7,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
72,8,I'm just really frustrated right now.
72,9,"I'm sorry, Joseph, I didn't mean to make you feel that way."
72,10,"I'm just trying to understand, that's all."
72,11,"I'm trying, but I'm not sure how much more I can."
72,12,"Ouch, that stings."
72,13,I can see this is frustrating for you.
72,14,I can't believe you'd say that.
72,15,"Oh, wow, that sounds really frustrating."
72,16,I just want to get better.
72,17,I can see you're really frustrated right now.
72,18,"I'm just trying to help you, that's all."
73,0,I understand you're frustrated and worried about Joey's situation.
73,1,I know you're frustrated right now.
73,2,I understand this is frustrating.
74,0,Hi there! How are you feeling today?
74,1,How are you doing today?
74,2,Okay.
74,3,Okay.
74,4,"Yes, I do."
74,5,Okay.
74,6,"Okay, I'm listening."
74,7,It has.
74,8,"I know, it's confusing."
74,9,I can see how that would be disappointing.
74,10,I know this is probably a lot to take in right now.
74,11,I can see this is really upsetting you.
74,12,"This is hard, isn't it?"
74,13,I can hear the hurt in your voice.
74,14,"Wow, that’s… that’s really nice of you to say."
74,15,"Oh, wow."
74,16,"Oh, wow."
74,17,Sure.
74,18,I'm really not sure how to feel right now.
74,19,"Oh, wow..."
75,0,"That sounds like fun, I'd be up for it!"
76,0,"It's tough, isn't it?"
76,1,"Okay, here I go."
76,2,You seem pleased.
76,3,I'm ready.
76,4,"Oh, yeah?"
76,5,"I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating."
76,6,"Oh, I see."
76,7,"Oh, wow, yeah, I can see how that would be distracting."
76,8,"Oh, yeah, I get it."
76,9,"Oh, man, that's gotta be a real mood killer."
76,10,"Oh, that's gotta be the worst."
76,11,"Oh, that's so frustrating!"
76,12,"Ugh, that is so awkward and frustrating."
76,13,"Oh, that's... that's rough."
76,14,"Oh, wow, that's gotta be incredibly awkward."
76,15,"I'm so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating."
76,16,"I didn't mean to, I swear."
77,0,"Oh, are you surprised?"
77,1,"Oh, is she alright?"
77,2,"It's so interesting to see those family resemblances, isn't it?"
77,3,I can see why you feel that way.
77,4,I miss her too.
77,5,It must be hard to be reminded of that all the time.
77,6,It's okay to not be ready.
77,7,That must feel really frustrating.
77,8,"I understand, it's tough when things are complicated."
77,9,It must be so hard.
77,10,It's gotta be hard.
77,11,I just don’t understand why it ended.
77,12,That sounds exhausting.
77,13,I understand.
77,14,That must be so hard.
77,15,"I know, it feels like everyone is getting together."
77,16,I understand that must be tough.
77,17,"I am sorry, that must be difficult."
77,18,It must be so hard to know what the right choice is.
77,19,Maybe.
78,0,"It's such a good feeling, isn't it?"
78,1,I haven't driven in ages.
78,2,It sounds like you're feeling really stressed right now.
78,3,"I'm just trying to lighten the mood, I guess."
78,4,I think I'm going to be sick.
78,5,I can see how that might be a little concerning right now.
78,6,I'm really scared right now.
78,7,"Yeah, I do."
78,8,I think I'm going to be sick.
79,0,I missed you too.
79,1,"Yeah, it felt a little empty without you."
79,2,"I'm not really feeling up to anything, I'm sorry."
79,3,Maybe we could just stay in?
79,4,"I'm sorry, is something wrong?"
79,5,I guess I do.
79,6,"That sounds really stressful, I'm sorry."
79,7,I know it's a lot to process.
79,8,"I know, it's just... a lot to think about."
79,9,"I know, it's a lot to process."
79,10,I understand that's not ideal.
80,0,Hi! I don't think so.
80,1,"I haven't, sorry."
80,2,I was really hoping he'd be here.
80,3,"Wow, that sounds like a big decision."
80,4,I'm so excited!
80,5,"Wow, that's a big trip."
80,6,I'm just really excited to go.
80,7,"Wow, that's incredible news!"
80,8,"I don't know yet, but I'm so excited!"
80,9,"Wow, that's soon!"
81,0,"Yes, please, come in and have a seat."
81,1,Is everything alright?
81,2,"Please, have a seat."
82,0,"Oh, really? That must have been frustrating."
82,1,Right? It's frustrating when they act up like that.
82,2,"Oh, so it was a person being difficult, not just the machine?"
82,3,"Oh, that must be frustrating."
82,4,"Oh, that sounds frustrating."
82,5,"Oh, that's so frustrating!"
82,6,That's so frustrating!
82,7,I wish I could.
82,8,That really stinks.
82,9,That sounds really frustrating.
82,10,That really sucks.
82,11,I can understand that would be frustrating.
82,12,That sounds incredibly frustrating.
82,13,"Wow, that's great!"
82,14,What’s it for?
82,15,"Oh, no, what's up?"
82,16,That's a tough spot to be in.
82,17,"That's a really big deal, Joe."
82,18,"This is so great, I can’t wait to tell you!"
83,0,I understand your frustration.
83,1,"I don't know, I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed right now."
83,2,I understand.
83,3,I know we've been through a lot.
83,4,"I know, I remember."
83,5,I can't believe you're actually considering this.
83,6,It sounds like you're feeling really secure in our relationship.
83,7,"I know, right?"
84,0,"No, I didn't."
84,1,He just mumbled something and ran off!
84,2,"Oh, that must have been so awkward!"
84,3,"I don't know, it was just a weird situation."
84,4,"Oh, you were scared, too?"
84,5,That must be incredibly painful.
84,6,I just froze.
84,7,"Oh, wow, that must have been incredibly stressful."
85,0,That must have been disappointing.
85,1,"Oh, wow."
85,2,"Oh, wow."
85,3,"No, you haven't."
85,4,"Oh, you must be feeling so anxious right now!"
85,5,"I’m sorry, that must have been difficult."
85,6,"I'm so sorry, that must have been really awkward."
85,7,I'm glad you're happy!
85,8,I understand you're feeling confused.
85,9,I’m so confused.
85,10,I can see how that would feel confusing.
85,11,"I'm so sorry, that must feel really violating."
85,12,I can't believe you would say that.
85,13,I can’t believe this is happening.
85,14,That must be so frustrating.
85,15,"Oh, wow."
85,16,"I'm so sorry, that must feel really uncomfortable."
86,0,"I'm so nervous, but I'm trying my best."
86,1,"Oh, honey, that sounds rough."
86,2,"I'm sorry, that sounds really tough."
86,3,It sounds like you were really feeling lost there for a bit.
87,0,It sounds like you're disappointed.
87,1,I understand that this is difficult.
87,2,I understand.
87,3,It sounds like you're a bit overwhelmed with the options.
87,4,I understand your urgency.
88,0,It must feel like a real shock to you.
88,1,"This is just so frustrating, isn't it?"
88,2,"I know, it must be so frustrating to find out."
88,3,"I am upset, I just can’t believe this is happening."
88,4,I understand you're really angry right now.
88,5,I just… I don’t know what to say.
89,0,Hey.
89,1,I really hope so.
89,2,I can hear the urgency in your voice.
89,3,"Oh, honey, that sounds awful."
89,4,"Oh, honey, that sounds incredibly painful."
89,5,"It's okay, accidents happen."
89,6,I can see you're in a lot of pain.
89,7,"It's okay, accidents happen."
89,8,That must be a relief.
89,9,I'm glad you're feeling better!
89,10,I'm so glad you're feeling better!
90,0,"Okay, Dad, I will."
90,1,"I know, it's hard to believe."
90,2,"Oh, wow, that must have been a surprise."
90,3,"At a bar, I guess."
90,4,It's apple juice.
90,5,"I'm so sorry, that must have been so awkward."
90,6,It sounds like you're really beating yourself up over this.
91,0,That must have been a strange urge.
91,1,"Oh, wow."
91,2,So... you're not bothered?
91,3,"Oh, wow."
91,4,I understand that you don't see what the problem is.
91,5,"I don't know, I just... I don't know."
91,6,I think you're missing the point here.
91,7,I just... I don't understand what's happening.
91,8,I can't believe you wouldn't even try it.
91,9,I can't believe you're so against it.
91,10,"Oh, Phoebe."
92,0,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
92,1,"Oh, I am so sorry!"
92,2,"Oh, honey, are you okay?"
92,3,I'm so sorry!
92,4,"Oh, no!"
92,5,"I know, right?"
92,6,"Oh, honey."
92,7,I don't know!
92,8,"Oh, honey."
92,9,"I know, right?"
92,10,"Oh, that's such a letdown!"
92,11,"I am so, so sorry!"
93,0,She's really struggling right now.
93,1,I'm so relieved to hear that.
93,2,"It's still a bit of a mess, but it's growing back."
93,3,"Oh, man, that's rough."
93,4,That's a relief.
93,5,"Of course, but let's be gentle."
93,6,"Okay, I'll be right there."
93,7,"I'm doing okay, all things considered."
94,0,That must make your job a lot easier.
94,1,"I'm just a little nervous, that's all."
94,2,"I understand, you don't want to."
94,3,"I just don't want to, okay?"
94,4,Like what?
94,5,I just don't know if I can.
94,6,"So, you really don't like cantaloupe juice, huh?"
94,7,I just don't like cantaloupe juice.
94,8,"I understand, it's a little intimidating to try something new."
94,9,I don't think I want to.
94,10,"You really don't want to try it, do you?"
94,11,"You're really not going to try it, are you?"
95,0,That would be really frustrating.
95,1,"That would make this all so much harder, wouldn't it?"
95,2,It must feel like a real betrayal.
95,3,That must have been a real blow.
95,4,"That's a tough break, I can see why you're frustrated."
95,5,It's frustrating when you feel like you've been wronged.
95,6,I guess I can be a bit much sometimes.
95,7,It's just frustrating when you feel like you've been misled.
95,8,It’s just frustrating when you feel like you’re being played.
95,9,"I guess we were a bit much, huh?"
95,10,It sounds like you're feeling a bit blamed and confused.
96,0,"Oh, that sounds incredibly uncomfortable."
96,1,"Thank you, I really appreciate it."
96,2,I can imagine that must be frustrating.
96,3,"Ha, I can see how that might be awkward."
97,0,It sounds like you're really excited!
97,1,"It's even better in person, right?"
97,2,I'm so glad you're excited!
97,3,"I know, right? It's just... perfect."
97,4,"It really is, isn’t it?"
97,5,You seem so excited!
97,6,I'm so glad!
97,7,"Oh, wow, I can't wait to see!"
97,8,"Oh, you're curious!"
97,9,"Oh, Monica, you’re so excited!"
97,10,"Oh, wow, that would be a problem."
97,11,"Oh no, that's awful!"
97,12,I can see how that would be a little concerning.
97,13,"Oh, Monica, this is all a bit much, isn't it?"
97,14,"I understand, it can be a lot to take in."
97,15,"I am so sorry, that sounds really stressful."
97,16,I can see why you're feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.
97,17,I can see why you're frustrated.
97,18,"I'm sorry, is this upsetting you?"
97,19,"I am so sorry, this is a lot to take in."
97,20,"I am so sorry, this must be overwhelming."
97,21,I’m so stressed right now.
98,0,"Okay, I'm ready."
98,1,"I understand, it's hard."
98,2,I understand this is difficult.
98,3,I'm just trying to help.
98,4,It sounds like you're really struggling with this.
99,0,"Oh wow, I bet you're really excited about it!"
99,1,I'm so excited!
99,2,"Oh no, what happened?"
99,3,"It's beautiful, isn't it?"
99,4,You're so excited!
99,5,I'm so excited for you!
99,6,That's amazing!
99,7,I was so nervous!
99,8,That sounds like such a wonderful night.
100,0,"Hi Emma, what's up?"
101,0,"I understand, it's difficult when you don't want something."
102,0,I don't know if I can.
102,1,Just take it.
103,0,"Oh, that must feel so validating."
103,1,"I know, it's just… disappointing."
103,2,"Oh, that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard."
103,3,That's a very good point.
103,4,"I'm so sorry, sweetheart."
104,0,That sounds like a wonderful feeling!
104,1,"Okay, I understand you're not feeling it right now."
104,2,What's on your mind?
104,3,I'm still a duck!
104,4,I'm listening.
104,5,"I'm really trying, I promise."
104,6,I'm not sure it will.
104,7,I love you too!
104,8,Are you surprised?
104,9,You sound a little flustered.
104,10,I'm so sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.
104,11,I think you did.
104,12,"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
104,13,I think you did.
104,14,I can't believe you're making me question myself like this.
104,15,I just want you to know I love you.
105,0,"Hey, how are you doing?"
105,1,"Oh, hi Monica!"
105,2,"Oh no, that must be so frustrating."
105,3,"Oh no, that must be so frustrating."
105,4,"Oh, that must be so frustrating."
105,5,"That sounds really nice, Monica."
105,6,I would love that.
105,7,Sunday works.
105,8,"Oh, I'm so sorry, is that not going to work?"
105,9,"Yeah, that feels like a long time from now."
105,10,What's wrong?
105,11,I'm really feeling down about this.
106,0,"Yeah, what about her?"
106,1,"Wow, that's so cool!"
106,2,"It was a class about different types of dance, and how your body moves."
106,3,"Oh, ouch."
106,4,"Wow, that's a big ask."
106,5,"Aw, that's a bummer."
107,0,I hear you.
107,1,I'm not feeling so terrific right now.
107,2,"Yes, I do, and I mean it."
107,3,I just feel like I mess everything up.
108,0,"Wow, that looks heavy."
108,1,"Wow, that sounds really tough."
108,2,"Oh no, are you alright?"
108,3,"I'm sorry, that must have been painful."
108,4,"I know, it stings, doesn't it?"
108,5,Are you alright?
108,6,That sounds really painful.
108,7,"Ouch, that must have been a bad one!"
108,8,"I know, right?"
108,9,"I know, right? I was hoping they'd be here."
108,10,"Oh, you're leaving already?"
108,11,It's good to see you too.
108,12,"I'm sure she's on her way, maybe there was traffic."
108,13,"I know it's hard to wait, but try to relax."
108,14,"I know, it's so stressful when you're waiting."
109,0,That must have been difficult.
109,1,"Oh, that must have been disappointing."
109,2,I understand your frustration; it's a lot to process.
109,3,"I'm so sorry you're feeling that way, Monica."
109,4,I'm really sorry you feel that way.
109,5,"I'm sorry, Monica, that sounds like a really tough realization to have."
109,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."
109,7,"I'm just really, really hungry."
110,0,"Yeah, that's really frustrating."
110,1,That must feel frustrating.
110,2,"I'm not sure, but it's definitely not the price I was expecting."
110,3,"Oh wow, that must feel a little frustrating."
110,4,It's frustrating when things feel so outdated.
110,5,That sounds wonderful!
110,6,"It really does, doesn't it?"
110,7,"No, they didn't."
110,8,That must make it even more special.
110,9,"It really does, doesn't it?"
111,0,"I'm sorry, that must be really hard to hear."
111,1,"I guess that stings a little, doesn’t it?"
111,2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was making you feel that way."
112,0,It sounds like you're really struggling right now.
112,1,I just... I don't know what to say.
112,2,"Oh, honey, I can see how much this is hurting you."
112,3,"Oh, you sound really upset."
112,4,"Oh, honey, I can hear the panic in your voice."
113,0,"Oh, wow, that's a lot to process."
113,1,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
113,2,I don't want him to.
113,3,Okay.
113,4,I understand this is a lot to take in.
113,5,"And it's a big deal, I know."
113,6,"I know, it's a lot to take in."
113,7,"Oh, honey."
113,8,"I know, it's a big change."
113,9,I understand this is hard.
113,10,I'm going to miss you too.
113,11,"I know, it's a big change."
113,12,"I know, it really is."
113,13,"It’s so weird, right?"
